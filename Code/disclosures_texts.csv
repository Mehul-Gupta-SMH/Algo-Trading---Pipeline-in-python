Ankit Arora — Head of Investor Relations,"With that said, I would now turn the call over to Kulin to share his views. Thank you, and over to you, Kulin.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"Thanks, Ankit. A very good afternoon to you all. Thank you for joining us for the Q4 results. We are very pleased with the strong operational performance this quarter. Despite tough market conditions, the company was able to register a growth of 24% in revenues and 45% in EBITDA. This was made possible by strong like-for-like growth and sell-throughs, which led to a significant GP expansion.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"Over the past two years, we have focused extensively on re-energizing our brand franchises and those efforts are now clearly bearing fruit. FY ’23 has been an exceptional year for AFL. Our sales grew by 45%, adding more than INR1,350 crores to the top line. Growth in EBITDA was far higher at 100%. Overall, EBITDA margins increased by 330 basis points. The key drivers for this significant expansion in EBITDA are increased sell-throughs and productivity in our retail channel the turnaround in Arrow profitability and operating leverage due to a much larger scale.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"As we exit the year, we feel confident that we will continue to see a significant expansion in our EBITDA margins moving forward. A very significant milestone for us is achieving a return on capital employed of close to 15%. We’ve stated a medium-term objective of reaching return on capital employed of 20% and that objective is now well within reach.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"Our North Star at AFL will be to achieve a high return on capital employed and strong operating cash flows. And hence, all the decisions we have taken in the past many years are towards achieving this objective. We exited unprofitable businesses, reduced asset intensity by increasing the share of franchising in our business, significantly improved our gross margins through better full price sell-through and dramatically reduced our gross working capital days.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"Strong controls on inventory have improved our inventory turns to more than 4 times. And by pivoting to a consignment model in our franchise network rather than the nine-sell [Phonetic] model, we have optimized our receivable days as well. We could have had an even higher EBITDA had we not made these business model changes, but these changes have resulted in a more robust business model, where we have full control over our inventory in the franchise stores and hence much better turns and lower receivables and therefore, higher return on capital employed.Our gross working capital days are the lowest in the company’s history and have gone down by 22 days over the last year. This strategy of investing strongly behind our power brands and scaling them up in this asset-light consignment driven business model in retail will ensure strong growth with strong operating cash flows in the years to come. The customer demand remains soft, but we believe we have many growth drivers to scale up our business. We will increase our retail penetration with a healthy store opening plan. Our direct-to-consumer online business is showing great promise and our new category expansion into footwear, kidswear and innerwear is gaining momentum.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"Our percentage EBITDA should continue to improve, driven by better productivity and sell-throughs, improvement in profitability of brands like Arrow and higher operating leverage. While we enter the new year with cautious optimism, we remain confident with the strength of our brands and our execution capabilities to navigate this environment.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,I would like to now hand it over to Shailesh to take us through the specifics and more details about the financial performance.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks a lot, Kulin, and good afternoon, friends. Two years back during the COVID pandemic, we had — AFL went on a path of decisive focus to put our entire weight behind re-energizing profitable growth. We’ve built one of its kind and very powerful portfolio of market-leading brands like U.S. Polo Association, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Arrow and Flying Machine. With this decisive focus, AFL has doubled its revenue in the last two years, going from nearly INR1,900 crores to now nearly INR4,500 crores, it’s a swing of INR2,500 crores in two years.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"In these two years, the growth in EBITDA has been even higher. In the previous year FY ’22, AFL saw INR140 crores swing in EBITDA. And now in just completed FY ’23 year, AFL EBITDA went up by another INR260 crores. AFL EBITDA has doubled in FY ’23 with gain in EBITDA percentage margin of 330 basis points. The growth in EBITDA in the last two years INR400 crores. Power brand EBITDA is at a healthy place at 12.6% at end FY ’23, delivering PBT swing at AFL of nearly INR240 crores and a PAT swing of nearly INR300 crores.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Q4 saw good results, starting with January, which finally saw the onset of peak winter. And with our strength in winter wear, we saw a very good full price sell-through of winter goods that time. and for the entire full season of fall holiday ’22. Q4 revenue at INR1,140 crores meant a growth of 24%, aided by like-to-like growth in retail of 17%. Department store grew 60%, and MBO channel grew by 50%. USPA in the whole year grew by nearly INR600 crores in NSV. Arrow also is now a sharpen avatar now and with an impressive swing in EBITDA, which is based on healthy full price sell-throughs and strong like-to-like growths.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Tommy and CK have continued their path of excellence and has crossed revenue scale of INR1,000 crores in this JV with extremely healthy margins. These brands lead the industry in retail experience and business KPIs. Flying Machine saw a new brand logo, launch of a new brand logo and a new brand architecture, and we are leaving no stone unturned to take FM scale to the desired ambitious levels in the next few years. Footwear business is showing very encouraging traction with its market-leading position and growth in 40% to 50% range with very healthy margins. We are premiumizing all our brands, and we have touch points in order to offer a differentiated brand experience to consumers. In addition to very profitable growth of brands, we have kept a keen eye on working capital that resulted in 10 days improvement in inventory and 12 days improvement in debtors in quarter four.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"The supply chain initiative of last two odd years, including focused project on core line has started to pay early dividends. In the current market conditions, we’ll continue to keep a keen eye on execution and operational rigor so that we continue to gain profitability through better retailing standards and higher full price sell-through. We see large growth potential in our brands, and we’ll continue to grow scale and gain scale leverage and make our brands more profitable. in our build versus buy strategy, capital efficiency will remain the key priority. Thank you.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Arora — Head of Investor Relations,"Rico, we can open it up now for Q&A.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Arora — Head of Investor Relations,Questions and Answers:,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,"Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Nishid Shah from Ambika Fincap. Please go ahead.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishid Shah — Ambika Fincap — Analyst,"Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a very, very good set of numbers. My first question is relating to the Sephora. On the online side, I think one year back, we discussed about it that we should be seeing some initiative. So, can you elaborate on this? Now what’s the situation? And how do we see it going forward?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Hi, sir. The situation on Sephora is — there is a status quo there. And we don’t have anything incremental to add and it remains currently a very prestigious offline business selling mortgage brands to women consumers. We haven’t sort of launched a new online initiative as yet.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishid Shah — Ambika Fincap — Analyst,"The experience at the store is excellent. In fact, it is much better than shopping at any of the international airport’s duty-free shops. So I was just wondering what is stopping us from launching Sephora online in India? It is there on nnnow.com. But if you have it as Sephora, it makes a whole lot of a difference. And there is a competition catching up with Nykaa and Reliance also launching on to it. I’m sure that it must be on the mind and you are working on it.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"We said this earlier as well, and this is one of the discussion points which we have with our partners. As Shailesh mentioned, we don’t have an update on that yet, but of course, it is an area which we are in constant discussions with the global Sephora team.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishid Shah — Ambika Fincap — Analyst,"My second question is relating to the overall size and the direction, you are right now at about INR4,400 crores going by the normal growth rate that you would expect to achieve over the next three years, you will be almost $1 billion or maybe $1 billion-plus. Would you like to elaborate on that?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Nishid, we won’t sort of comment what our current strategy is to grow the brand’s profitability and we don’t see any change of strategy. We’ll continue to grow our business at 12% to 15% CAGR, that’s our guidance to the market. And we stick to that guidance that in the medium-term, all our growth engines are still firing beyond store expansion, building marketplace capability online, also continue to focus on sell-through and grow the like-to-like growth of our store. Our adjacent categories are doing well. So we will continue to grow the way we have grown in the last two years and wherever it takes, it takes — we will stick to our strategy.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishid Shah — Ambika Fincap — Analyst,"Kulin, 12% to 15%, actually, 12% is the nominal GDP growth. If you look at 7% inflation and 6% to 7% growth, real growth, then we are talking about 13% to 14% nominal GDP growth. So if you say 12%, then you are going to actually be losing out on the market share. And you talked about so many initiatives, so many new category additions and all, then we should be at least aiming for at least 18% to 22% kind of a growth. Isn’t it?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"No, what you are saying is fair. I mean, if you look at our last few years, we have been growing fast, even adjusted for COVID and no decision we will take in the company will not maximize the growth potential. The only thing we will always do is we are wanting profitable growth where growth gets converted into very healthy operating cash flows. And you have been seeing how we have been delivering on that. So as long as we are able to grow with the healthy opportunity, there won’t be a stone unturned that the company will use every means possible to grow in a healthy fashion. Now with 15% as being our kind of median projection over the next three years, whether it is plus some percent points or minus percent points, depends on market conditions at that given point.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"But I think even the numbers which you have said, if the markets are very responsive even we have been growing at 18% in the past. I think what we want to be very clear about is that we want healthy growth in the company, and we will not take decisions to accelerate growth at the cost of strong bottom line and operating cash flows.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishid Shah — Ambika Fincap — Analyst,Yes. Thanks a lot for good answer on that. I’ll get back into the queue. Thank you very much.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, sir.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Darshil Jhaveri from Crown Capital. Please go ahead.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Darshil Jhaveri — Crown Capital — Analyst,"Hello. Good afternoon, sir, and thank you so much for taking my question. Firstly, sir, congratulations on a great set of results. Sir, with respect to our margins, now you finally consistent double-digit margin, so what kind of further leverage that we can see? Because we have a good adding of premium brands. So what would be our take in terms of our margins? Like we said you want to do it better, but some kind of a range that our target is maybe over the next two, three years?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So on the margin side, I will say, first, the — what are the inputs that will drive our margins and then we can talk about some percentage. So if you look at a lot of our focus is on the operational rigor, efficiency. So we look at both the product side and the retail side margin improvement, so on the product side, improving full price sell-through, reducing discounting, buying better, a lot more focus on that side.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"And we see an opportunity to grow our margin on the product side. Also on the channel mix, we are looking at getting higher business from more profitable channels, and we’re also trying to reduce our discounting. So overall, the efficiency, the product rigor and the retail rigor offline/online, both is likely to give us some uptick in the gross margin. In addition to that, we have the second bucket of turning around profitability of some brands even more. So happy that Arrow has turned around in FY ’23 and has a very large EBITDA swing from FY ’22. So that’s helping grow the GP for AFL. And we see that both Arrow and Flying Machine need to higher scale, they’re a little soft scale currently. And as they go in their journey for bigger scale, we will also get more margin coming from that.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"And the third side on the margin is the operating leverage. As we grow the scale like we have doubled our business in the last two years, and we continue to hopefully grow at market-leading growth rate, that will also flow into our additional margin EBITDA. So these are the broad sort of direction where the EBITDA is flowing. Now I talk to the specific guidance. See, we have a guidance for company that we need to grow our EBITDA close to 1.5% to 2% on an annual basis, that’s a minimum sort of guidance from our side. And we see that we will be able to continue to grow that space and if the markets are better, even at a higher pace.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Also in power brands, we will need to achieve double-digit EBITDA soon, and we are working very hard to that, and we have internal goals to reach that quickly. So those are the guidance that every year, we need to take the EBITDA at least 1.5% to 2% in that zone, I think more like 1.5% growth, and that will lead to the level that we’ll be happy with in next one to two years.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Darshil Jhaveri — Crown Capital — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Thank you so much for the detailed answer. So sir, with respect to, I think we’ve mentioned we might see some softening of demand. So would that — how are we seeing now two months in the year. So what is the consumer sentiment that we could see that what are we expecting? Is the demand issue that is why we are maybe focusing on 12% to 15% growth, because we’ve been growing at a very substantial rate. Could you just help me understand how the environment is currently?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"See, I would say the current market conditions are soft. And I would say despite the market condition, given the strength of our brand and our confidence in our ability to execute strongly, we are likely to deliver fairly competitive growth going forward. And as the market sort of improves which, likely to be from festival time, the growth rate still likely to go up further. So we will stay focused on our growth drivers, like I said, store expansion, building online marketplace, improving like-to-like growth in our store, growing adjacent category like footwear and kidswear, etc. So we will continue to fire on all of cylinders. We want to build these brands to mega brands and we will continue to focus on growing these businesses.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Darshil Jhaveri — Crown Capital — Analyst,"Okay, sir. That’s helpful. And if I may, sir, one more question. I just wanted to understand about our tax rate. So will we — because of our prior losses will that help in our taxation or how would that just happen?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,"This is Girdhar here, Girdhar Chitlangia. Yes, you’re right. There’s still — our accumulated losses will help us in our taxes in the future.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Darshil Jhaveri — Crown Capital — Analyst,"So going forward, what would be the effective tax rate? Because I think this year, we’ve still shown as 30%, so…",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,"So there are two things there. One is the tax regime and other it’s ultimately, we pay our tax. Two different questions here. So we are currently in the current tax regime only. And in the future, I mean, we keep evaluating. As and when we get an opportunity to move to a new regime, we will. Of course, we have the option of continuously utilizing our cost.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Darshil Jhaveri — Crown Capital — Analyst,"Okay, sir. So like if I can understand that we’re not paying out cash profit, it is just a book entry currently, if I could — that could make sense?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,Yes.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Darshil Jhaveri — Crown Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you so much for answering all my questions. All the best for the future.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ankit Kedia from PhillipCapital. Please go ahead.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Sir, my first question is regarding the working capital. I think excellent work on the inventory days and collection fee. Just wanted to understand, have you changed accounting with the franchisee owners or wholesalers to reduce the inventory or status quo on that front?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"See, over a — there’s nothing dramatically done in last one quarter, but over the last two, three years, we’ve been gradually changing the model to maximize ROCE and capital conversion. So we used to do a lot more outright billing in the past. But now we have moved — like the industry has also moved, to a consignment model. It’s been done gradually. It’s not like a one-off in quarter four. And we believe that’s the right model because the cash collection is faster there, our ability to manage the assortment of merchandise and drive the full price store in a more scientific automatic — automated way is better. So we like in this we’ve also made some changes, but they have been very gradual on this.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Sir, so in this, the inventory is on our books or on the franchisee books? And — or do we accounting and practical could be two different things, right? So if you can explain the buy-and-sell model historically and now consignment model, how is it different on paper and actually?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So in the past, then the outright model, the inventory gets transferred at the time of billing to the franchisees. And then that franchise is supposed to pay back to us as per the terms we have with the party. Now after that, the whole experience and the whole scientific rigor of ensuring very healthy sell-through as franchisee. All the tools are get transferred also the franchisee, we don’t even have visibility of level detailing. The industry, and we have moved to a consignment model where the goods — the title remains with us, with the company. And based on the sale, every day the sale gets elected, it’s transferred back to us. And at a pre-decided margin commission, we pay them on a monthly basis, the commission.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,So the inventory which is reduced is sitting on our books and despite that the inventory days have come down. Is that the right way to look at it?,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"That’s the right — also, what happens is that you’re right that with all this back-end being a little more scientifically handled, automated replenishment, the throughput of the inventory gets in our way, and it’s a scientific knowledge and now machines are doing it. So we need the whole inventory pool to be guided by the machine learning. Second part is that when the inventory is with us, it also gives the opportunity for us to do the omni business because we have a clear visibility of omni, then it gets sort of through, our own omni method gets exposed to the consumers online.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"And then we push the full price sell-through to the omni conversion also. And in our stores, A lot of our stores, the omni contribution is in high single-digits. So that’s a further push into full-price business. So you’re right in a way that despite the inventory being on our books, we are seeing much faster turns in our business. And like we mentioned, the stock turn have crossed four now.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"And sir, because of that from a revenue recognition perspective, now we are looking at full revenue and the expenses the franchisee commission comes as expenses because of this accounting. So that way, over three years, if the transition has happened over the last two, three years, the revenue has bumped up by that percentage of the franchisee commission?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, gross margin and the revenues do get slightly increased. But — and also the franchisee commission will come below the GP as an other expenses and profitability comes. So percentage EBITDA comes down in this model because the revenue recognition is at the MRP-ish level. whereas the margins are after reducing the expenses. But — so while the denominator goes up, but overall, we see in a medium-term, the — our ability to sell full price and lower discounting goes up. So that’s why overall EBITDA goes up. So basically, this is a model which is optimizing return on capital employed. So ROCE is North Star and this method gives us opportunity to do faster stock turn and improve ROCE.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Sure. Sir, in channel-wise, can you just help us with channel-wise margins on a ballpark basis, what they would be? And how are we looking at the mix here online MBO and retail business now?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So let me first give you a sense of — see, we are fortunate. We have multiple very well-developed channels, be retail, department store, trade, online. And within online, we have both wholesale as well as our own marketplace. So at an annualized level, our retail contribution now is around 43%, which has gone up by 4% in last year.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Department store is at that 12% to 13%. That also — because the department store took some more time to recover. So this year, we’ll see further continuing growth in department store percentage, and they are now at around 13%. Trade tends to be on an average at 15%, we are at around 17%. But between department store and trade that we get around 30%. Then we have a healthy online, we are the leader in the online space where our contribution has been between 20% to 25%. And then we have small other channels like export or liquidation, which is like 4% to 5% of the business.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"So this is the whole sort of a channel mix and our entire effort is to drive channels, which give us better opportunity to give experience so be it the retail channel, be it the online marketplace model. We prefer where we have a larger say on things like consumer experience, product assortment, discounting and fastest time. So that’s where our philosophy on the channel is currently.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"So from a margin perspective, then retail would give you the full control end-to-end. So is it fair to assume that the retail is the highest margin, while trade would be the least. But actually, I believe trade is the less margin, right, where you still don’t have control. So if you can just help us.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"See, every channel has its own dynamics on margin and expenses. So it will not be fair to answer that question. But our priority is to focus on experience right now.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"And on online own website versus third-party marketplace and a lot of there, we are seeing companies shifting to omni and not outright. How is that movement in online happening? And how does that impact margins?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"But that’s a major strategy for us to divert the online demand for our exciting brands to marketplace model. And in this quarter, our marketplace business grew by 75%. What happens is that in marketplace the whole assortment of inventory, we do it very scientifically. We create a lot of exclusive and very strong linkages with our stores on omni side. So overall, we are building this marketplace model very strongly, and we’re putting a lot of resources and energy behind that.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,So today it would be 50%?,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"Ending this model a bit very simplistically. In the older buy-and-sell model in online, you would sell actual inventory to the partners. And then the control of how they sell it at what price they sell it, it’s with them. And it also meant that your inventory then is in different places with different partners. In a marketplace model, the inventory all is with us, in our warehouses and our stores. And because the inventory is centralized and all the demand comes to one centralized pool of inventory, we not only control the pricing in the presentation, but the same inventory pool is catering to all the demand.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"So it is a much more efficient way to even get inventory sell-throughs to happen. So I think the pivot towards marketplace is a very strategic one. It means our company has to also obviously developed capabilities around not only fulfilling the orders, along with the — I mean, from our stores and warehouses, but also maintaining the listing, creating demand. These are all now very scientific new age capabilities, and that has — those capabilities have been built by the company over the last two years. So we are pivoting even our online business from a buy and sell to more of a marketplace model, where we take full control. So that is the strategic significance of the shift we are making.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Sure. If I can ask one last question? This quarter, there is some discontinued operations around INR1 crore loss. Any brand talking of getting the license go, is it to do with those businesses?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"So Ankit, just to clarify, we had our old inventory for the discontinued operations, which is what we had done over the last two years. We have completely cleaned that in this quarter. And it’s just a minor loss, which is coming on account of that and there is nothing else apart from that.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Understood. Thank you so much, and all the best.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Pritesh Chheda from Lucky Investment Managers. Please go ahead.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"Yes. Hello sir, congratulations for the growth and the balance sheet inventory turns. I’m still unable to understand what is the pre-Ind AS bridge of — or pre-Ind AS margin that we would have at this scale of business vis-a-vis the scale of business that we had recovered. If you could give those two numbers, it would be very helpful to understand your margin movements?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"See, the post-Ind AS result that we declared, typically, the pre-Ind AS numbers are — there’s a gap of — the difference of around 4%. And you can calculate that yourself. And if I look at the last two years our EBITDA growth, we have done really well. I mean we’ve doubled in the last financial year itself. And in terms of our ROCE, debt level, EBITDA level, we’ve been probably at the healthiest we have seen. From pre-COVID to now, we have seen major changes.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"We have driven some of those changes ourselves in terms of change of model from outright to a consignment model. And a lot of those things have been now. And if you look at last two, three years, we’ve been really focused on increasing our EBITDA. Last year itself, our EBITDA has gone up by 330 basis points. So we are on a healthy trajectory, and we expect that our drivers of margin improvement will continue to go forward. Yes, in that sense, we’re ahead of the pre-COVID EBITDA, when you look at our company results overall on our debt level on inventory levels, level, EBITDA level, we are moving forward.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"So if your pre-Ind AS margin of 6%, you reported is 10% minus 4%, 6%, for a scale of business of INR4,500 crores, we have competing players who have a fairly higher pre-Ind AS margin. So what all steps are still needed? Or if you could tell us the bridge, why are the margins still single-digit?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"See, our EBITDA for the full year is 12.1%. If — you can calculate the pre-Ind AS number, and we’ve really moved forward. Yes, there may be some players who have a higher EBITDA margins than us, and we will continue to improve further. A couple of dynamics, it could be in terms of royalty payments, it could also be a need for us to turn around Arrow in profitability further, to scale up Flying Machine further. So there are a lot of levers and job for us to do, friend. We focus on that, and we are very confident and working hard towards improving our EBITDA further every year.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"What is the drag which comes from Arrow and Flying Machine and the emerging businesses in your EBITDA, if you could give us that it would be very helpful for us to understand what is the EBITDA margin on the residual business?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"So let’s see Arrow as a brand. COVID was really tough for the formal brands and that business and very largely retail-driven business went into losses. And what we have done now is that by making a lot of changes to Arrow, which we have spoken a lot in our past investor calls, we’ve turned around this brand. And this FY ’23 end, it is now low single-digits. It used to be loss making earlier, there’s a large swing in Arrow. So Arrow is at a low single-digit. Many of our brands are at a pre-Ind AS double-digit EBITDA already. You look at our power brand portfolio EBITDA in quarter four itself, you see is at 13.1% post Ind AS. So you can calculate where it is.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"And Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, U.S. Polo, footwear, I mean, overall, U.S. Polo is all in double-digit EBITDA already. The brand like Arrow, we have turned around, we are happy about it, but there is a journey ahead to improve it scale further and improve its profitability further.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"Okay. And the emerging brand, what is a drag now from the emerging brand to our EBITDA?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"So if you really see the full year, the emerging brand EBITDA has gone up from 2% earlier to this year is around 5.9%. The emerging brands have improved, and that’s largely coming from Calvin Klein. The other brands that group are Sephora, where the EBITDA margins have remained stable. And discontinued brands like Ed Hardy, IZOD and Aeropostale, where we have a INR5 crore to INR7 crore royalty hit for next one to two years, and that’s the drag that we have currently.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"So basically, when you report 6% in your PPT in emerging brands, minus 4%, so basically emerging brand is at about 2% pre-Ind AS margin. And in power brands, if you say your pre-Ind AS double-digit, is it right that you are pre-Ind AS double-digit margin in U.S. Polo and Tommy and you’re losing some money in, let’s say, Flying Machine and Arrow. Is that the interpretation?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"I would say the interpretation is that Tommy, Calvin Klein, U.S. Polo or double-digit pre-Ind AS. Arrow and Flying Machine are at a stage where there are low profitability. And we believe scale once we improve the scale of these brands, they will also become higher profitable.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Thank you very much.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Shreyansh Jain from Swan Investments. Please go ahead.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shreyansh Jain — Swan Investments — Analyst,Hello.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,"Yes sir, please go ahead. Your line has been unmuted.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shreyansh Jain — Swan Investments — Analyst,"Yes. Congratulations on a great set of numbers, sir. My first question is again on…",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,"Mr. Shreyansh, may we request you to use the handset.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shreyansh Jain — Swan Investments — Analyst,Hello? Is it better? Hello?,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,"Yes, sir, go ahead.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shreyansh Jain — Swan Investments — Analyst,"Yes. Congrats on a great set of numbers. Sir, my first question is last quarter when we had done the call, you had told us about how operating leverage will now start kicking in. But now if you just look at your gross margin and EBITDA margins, you obviously EBITDA margins have improved, but the kind of leverage that we were expecting has not actually come through. So one is on the other expenses bit. And I think last quarter, you had also mentioned that as retail grows, other expenses also tend to grow.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shreyansh Jain — Swan Investments — Analyst,"But just wanted some more granularity in the sense that quarter-on-quarter, last four quarters, we see this number from INR300 crores is now at INR400 crores-odd. And when I look at some other companies like Aditya Birla, their percentage of other expenses to sales is not as high as ours, so just wanted some fundamental understanding of what is driving this increase in other expenses?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So let’s see, let’s start with GP to EBITDA and other expenses, we’ll cover in that. So first point is that we are getting a healthy scale leverage already. In the full year, we’ve seen more than 2%, 200 basis point improvement in EBITDA coming from scale leverage in FY ’23. Even in the quarter four, we’ve seen out of our growth in EBITDA of 1.9%, 190 basis points, 0.5% improvement in EBITDA out of that has come from scale leverage. So scale average is kicking in and it will continue to grow. That’s the one sort of statement of fact.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Now if you look at our GP for quarter four, our GP has gone up by 7%. Now out of that, 2% is because of a technical model change in Tommy Hilfiger where we went from on outright to consignment. And that happened early April, and this is the last quarter where from year-to-year comparison, you will see that change in other expenses because almost INR25 crores of that expense has come as higher GP and then it’s coming as higher operating expense also.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"So 2% out of that 7% is one-off technical. I mean, we changed this in April, and now it will continue and in comparison from last year will not come from the quarter one. So that’s one technical reason that 7% actually is a 5% GP growth, which is, in a way, as per target healthy growth. Now if you look at 5% GP increase. Out of that, close to 2% has flown into EBITDA. Now the balance 3%, what has happened is that as the sale is increasing, and we have grown like really at a healthy pace of 45%, then other expenses are also growing because a lot of franchisee commissions, royalty, supply chain costs like warehousing and freight, etc., have come below that.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"So out of that 3%, 2% is going as variable. A lot of it is basically commissioned 1%, 0.5% is select. So out of the 3%, 2% comes as variable. We have scale leverage coming in from lower land cost, which is around 0.5%. And we had, in this quarter, slightly lower other income than in the past. And because of that, there was an EBITDA drop of EBITDA. So out of that 5%, 3% is flowing in, then there are some expenses and then there is a scale average of 0.5%, which actually leads to 1.9% EBITDA.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Now coming specifically to other expenses, I will just give you a little more color on the other expenses of quarter four versus quarter three, but one reason clearly is because of the sales increase, and there’s a one-off technical reason of Tommy Hilfiger around INR25 crores moving from — when we moved from outright to consign one model early this year. Girdhar, our CFO, will explain a little more about the other expenses.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,"So if you see quarter-on-quarter, the other expenses have gone up largely because our department store sales have gone up, in which significantly refunding higher increase in commission expenses. Also in Q4, last year, we were a little subdued on our expenses, and most of our expenses are now back to normal levels. So that has also impacted slightly our expenses.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Because last January was COVID, so most of the retail everything was shut, right? So the retail also was lower on that basis. But now this year, we have grown on January because of COVID not there, but then our other expense has also grown in proportion to the sales.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shreyansh Jain — Swan Investments — Analyst,"Okay. So sir, just coming back to this. So when we guide for about 12% to 15-odd percent top line growth, so is it a fair understanding that we should build in 10% to 12% growth in your other expenses component as well?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So in the channel where the commission comes in. So for example, a lot of our mono brand store is retail and marketplace also has a commission. So in terms — in line with the sales, but a slightly lower percentage of that will come as other expense.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,"Not all our expenses are fixed in nature, but we’ll surely get some leverage on this account.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shreyansh Jain — Swan Investments — Analyst,"No. But higher the channel sales than higher the commission and brokerage, right?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. Understand. So that is, of course, variable. But what I’m saying is of all the other expenses, not everything is fixed or variable in nature. There are solid fixed expenses, which we will surely get leverage off.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shreyansh Jain — Swan Investments — Analyst,"All right. And sir, somewhere in the call, you mentioned that Arrow has now turned profitable. And now just looking at your profit for the full year, so we’ve done about INR50 crores-odd profit in the Tommy, CK JV. So that in itself would have been INR100 crores-odd because 50% is our share. And when I look at your profit before minority interest for the full year, it’s at about INR87 crores-odd. So is there a INR13 crore loss that is still sitting that you’ve done in this year? I mean is that from Flying Machine? Is that understanding correct?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Arora — Head of Investor Relations,"Shreyansh, Ankit here. So what you are seeing is the swing in — from negative INR267 crore to plus INR36 crore in PAT after minority interest. You are right, as to what Shailesh earlier explained is we have brands like Arrow and Flying Machine which are low on profitability. And of course, the drag on account of our discontinued brands, which is there is a fixed cost. So that does have a drag on PAT for FY ’23. But as to what you can see there is a significant stride, which is what we have made from FY ’22 to ’23, and we expect this momentum to continue in the years to come, and you will see that in FY ’24 as well.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shreyansh Jain — Swan Investments — Analyst,"Okay. All right. And just last question on the debt bit, sir. I see in your cash flow, we’ve increased debt by about INR130 crores-odd. So I just wanted some clarity on that because I think we were on the debt reducing spree, but all of a sudden we’ve gone ahead and increased debt?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,"You see largely our endeavors to reduce debt, and we expect it to have a downward trajectory. FCF for the year will be used to pay down our debt. This is what is going to be our…",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"See, our debt levels, if you look at in FY ’23 ending close to INR600 crores, it’s gone up by INR100 crores. For a sale growth is so much higher. And if you look at our working capital days have come down. So this increase in debt is largely linked to the increase of scale and our inventory levels are healthier and we’ve dropped 10 days in inventory, we are higher by almost INR100 crores because the kind of growth, 45% growth we have seen in that the value of inventory has gone up by almost INR100 crores and our debt levels have also gone up by close to INR100 crores because of that.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"But if you look at the scale of operation that has gone up, our overall — the inventory days have come down significantly. Our total TWC and NWC turns have become better. And we think that we will grow our capex, etc., from our internal accruals, and we don’t have any organic plan. So our debt levels are to be very similar or maybe a little lower as we go along forward.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shreyansh Jain — Swan Investments — Analyst,Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jatin Sangwan from Burman Capital. Please go ahead.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Jatin Sangwan — Burman Capital — Analyst,"Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats for the amazing set of results. I noticed that in your balance sheet you’re right of use assets have increased substantially from March ’22 levels and even from September ’22 levels. So what’s the reason behind this? And would it have any effect on the depreciation in the interest component that will come in FY ’24?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,"So you see, we have opened 39 stores, okay, and which is basically a leading us to this higher number on the balance sheet, but I don’t see any increase in interest outgo on account of this. Of course, I mean, the Ind AS accounting will have to happen for these lease — newly leased properties. But apart from that, there is no cash of flow on this.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"See, if you look at Tommy Hilfiger business, it’s a very high cash generating business, growing really well and profitability growing even higher. Now as a part of our capital allocation strategy, we see takeover stores because we’re sitting on cash in the bank, it’s a very good because the IRR you get in the Tommy store is very, very high. So it’s very prudent from a capital allocation strategy to use that cash lying in the bank to build stores and get a higher return on that investment into the stores.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Jatin Sangwan — Burman Capital — Analyst,Okay. Got it. And how many stores of Tommy Hilfiger currently on FOFO model? And what is your target rate?,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"See around close to 35 stores — see Tommy has more than 100-odd stores, out of which 35 around we have done now take over FOFO stores.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Jatin Sangwan — Burman Capital — Analyst,And what’s the target for FY ’24 and ’25?,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"We will wait and watch. We will evaluate it. So I don’t have a ready answer to give you, but we will explore opportunity to increase our profitability by every other mean.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Jatin Sangwan — Burman Capital — Analyst,"Okay, sure. And also, I noticed that employee expenses have increased around 10% Q-o-Q. So is it because the retail — share of retail channel has increased or it was some part of one-time bonus payment? And second question is on what’s the steady level of employee spends we should look at?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,"You see the Q4 expenses have gone up, as you rightly picked up because of the bonus and variable capex in Q4. On a steady state, our salaries and overheads will be between…",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Arora — Head of Investor Relations,"Jatin, Ankit here. Just to clarify, you should look at employee cost on a year-on-year basis, it has gone up from INR237 crores to INR268 crores. It will increase in line with inflation. So you should probably build around 10% of increase in employee costs for FY ’24.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Jatin Sangwan — Burman Capital — Analyst,"Okay, sure. Thank you. That was the last question from my end.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ankit Kedia from PhillipCapital. Please go ahead.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Sir, what is the overall store opening guidance across brands for the next two years? Because if I also look at the city count in U.S. Polo, you have present been around 175-odd cities, Tommy for the last five years, we’re present in sub-40, CK is sub-32 cities, Arrow, the store count is on a reduction, city is also on a reduction; Flying Machine also now you’re planning to relaunch the brand; Sephora, there has been no store addition. How should we look at this over the next two years now and which model each of these brands on the store front?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"So store expansion is a key growth driver for our brands. All our brands are we see huge opportunity and untapped potential to expand in the big city and the suburb of big city as well in the smaller tier towns. Now our guidance is to open close to 200 stores, that’s our guidance for FY ’24 as well that we opened close to 175 stores in last year. And we will continue to focus on that because our traction in our store is good.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Our share of revenue coming from our EBO channel is going up. It’s doing good business for us. So we see opportunity to grow in these stores. And as we stand today, the numbers that city you — you’re giving our numbers are really gone higher. And just to clarify that U.S. Polo has now crossed 200 towns. Tommy is available in now 70 towns.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"So the store count also has gone up — sorry, what I meant city. Tommy is available in 70-plus cities, U.S. Polo is available in more than 200 cities. So the numbers from the last time the data you’ve seen our numbers have gone higher, and we continue to grow sensibly our store count.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"And sir, what is the capex guidance? Because if I look at the math, debt has gone up. And if you suggested that from a free cash flow, we plan to pay our debt. So if the capex of 200 stores, assuming 60%, 70% would be on FOFO model and not 20%, 25% could be on COCO model, still there will be substantial capex in the business. So how much debt over the next two years can be pay down with 200 store expansion every year?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,"Ankit, we are expecting our capex for next year to be around INR100 crores, a large part going towards refurbishing some of the stores. And also, we are spending some money on upgrading our IT systems. But all this, we are expecting to do with our internal approvals. And I don’t expect any further debt to be taken on account of this.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Yes. Sir, but debt reduction is also important. So do you see debt reduction happening if not debt increasing?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Girdhar Kumar Chitlangia — Chief Financial Officer,"So we earlier answered that question, and we said any further FPF will actually go towards reduction of debt. Shailesh just mentioned that largely, we are hoping that our debt will remain very, very consistent. And if at all, it will actually go down.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"So over the next two years, we are looking to maintain these debt levels or marginally reduced if you generate free cash flow?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"We are quite confident of cash generation from our business and our capex needs are for specific need. So there’s no major because our expansion is asset-light through partners. So in stable market condition, we’re very confident of our debt level going down in the next two years because we are very confident of generating further cash from our operations.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,Sure. And one last question. What is the pre-Ind AS rental we would have paid this year?,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,Rental.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Arora — Head of Investor Relations,"Ankit, that number would be somewhere in the range of about INR180 crores to INR200 crores.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,Which is lower than last year’s absolute rental number?,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Arora — Head of Investor Relations,"I will have to check that. It would have gone up in my assessment, probably on account of because FY ’22 was impacted by COVID. And of course, we have opened a lot more stores and the retail expenses coming back. my assessment is the rental would have gone up from ’22 to ’23.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Sure, I’ll take this offline. So — and the other income or one time rental benefit, I believe the rentals would have come down, but I can take it offline.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Arora — Head of Investor Relations,"Sure, we will do that.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Ankit Kedia — PhillipCapital — Analyst,Thank you.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dhviti from Molecule Ventures. Please go ahead.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Dhviti Shah — Molecule Ventures LLP — Analyst,"Hello, sir. Congratulations on a good set of numbers. So my first question is regarding U.S. PA in the PPT, we have mentioned about doing INR2,000 crore of NSV. So what has it been in FY ’23? And what will be the delta in the brand going forward?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"USPA has done really well in terms of growth. Delta this year in FY ’23 over previous year is close to INR600 crores. So it’s almost like size of a big brand that we added in one year. It’s still not reached INR2,000 crore, let me clarify that, but it’s in a journey, it should hit INR2,000 crore top line very soon. And it is a leading player in the main casual segment in the country, and we’ll continue to dominate that segment.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Dhviti Shah — Molecule Ventures LLP — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, the adjustment categories, if you could give annual revenue breakup for each of your kidswear, footwear, innerwear?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"See, we will be in the brands where we have big adjacent category like U.S. Polo, Tommy Hilfiger, the number, we will hit close to double-digit revenue share very soon. The growth rates in these brands are very — in this segment is very high. Footwear is growing at 40% to 50%. Kidswear has been growing at around 25%. And we continue to pilot some new categories in the background doing some small piloting all the time. So these categories will continue to grow very rapid pace.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Dhviti Shah — Molecule Ventures LLP — Analyst,"Okay. Also, sir, USPA, can we assume that it has done around INR1,800 crores-odd in FY ’23?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Very close to that. I mean, give and take some crores here or there, but you are very close to that number.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Dhviti Shah — Molecule Ventures LLP — Analyst,"Okay. So next question is regarding Arrow. So last few quarters, we have been talking about the brand earning EBITDA positive. So what will be the EBITDA margin for FY ’23? And how do you look those going forward?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"See, like I said, COVID was harsh to this category. This year, we did a large swing in EBITDA, very, very large and it’s turned EBITDA positive. But still, the EBITDA margin in Arrow in FY ’23 is low single-digits. And the idea is to take it to mid single-digit very, very quickly because once our model is working and the consumers are buying that model with newer categories like super premium 1851 or new smart casual line called Arrow Sport. So a lot of things are trending really well. The like-for-like growth and [Indecipherable] and Arrow are very, very healthy.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"We’ve also done updation of reliability and we are opening more and more stores so with that energy that Arrow has, we are gunning for fairly high growth and with that scale, we are also gaining leverage along with the efficiency. So the next milestone is to hit mid single-digit EBITDA in Arrow in near future.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Dhviti Shah — Molecule Ventures LLP — Analyst,"Okay. Sir, if you could give the OPM for current quarter in Arrow. If that’s possible.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,We don’t give brand specific details. We can…,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Dhviti Shah — Molecule Ventures LLP — Analyst,Okay. Sure sir. Thank you.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Operator,"Thank you. Due to time constraints, our last question is from the line of Gautam Rathi from CWC. Please go ahead.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishit Rathi — CWC Advisors — Analyst,This is Nishid. Am I audible?,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Shailesh Chaturvedi — Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Hi, Nishid, you’re audible. Hi.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishit Rathi — CWC Advisors — Analyst,"Hi. Great set of numbers, guys. Just a question. I just wanted to understand, I could not understand the debt comment actually made by the CFO. Actually, because in my understanding, you guys have done a very decent OCF this year despite INR150 crores — INR130 crores-odd that was used in working capital, right? And your guiding for EBITDA margin expansion going forward on the overall revenues, which will basically give you even further ammunition.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishit Rathi — CWC Advisors — Analyst,"And your OCF may not accrue — your working capital may not increase at the same level because you may not add the same amount of absolute revenue that you are talking about. So I just — am I missing something? Are you — because it just appears to be — it doesn’t tie up, right? I can’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be reducing debt substantially every year, right? And even this year, right, we accrued cash, right, our net debt is flat. Our gross debt has increased for some reason, but our net debt is flat, right? So going forward, shouldn’t we be accruing at least INR100 crores of FCF, if not more?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"This is Kulin here. You are very right that with the increase in profitability and now last year was a one-time where we saw almost a 50% revenue growth because of a COVID base, but now with a naturalized natural growth rate and a much improved profitability and a small capex amount, the business will be generating free cash flow. So let me be very clear in stating that. But the environment is a little uncertain. So we are kind of being a little cautious in our guidance, but definitely, debt will be going down it has a downward bias. And every year, we believe the amount of FCF the company will be generating will be going up significantly.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishit Rathi — CWC Advisors — Analyst,"Kulin, I fully understand. So basically, what you’re saying is, if your other guidance is hold, which is improved profitability and steady growth rate then you will generate this. Now is the only scenario in which you don’t generate FCF is, let’s say, the environment deteriorates sharply. Even there, the growth will slow down, the working capital will get controlled and you will control the capex and/or the growth goes through the roof wherein you again consume some working capital, but again, you will generate much better profitability, right? So most of the scenarios going forward from — your guidance for better ROCE which we will be getting much better OCF/FCF — better CF conversion, right? That’s right, right?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"No, you are right. I mean there is no scenario where we see debt going up. And in terms of its downward bias, it will — as you explained or as you mentioned, it will be a function of how the scenarios play out in a scenario where the markets are good, which we do believe that the market I’m going to pick up in the next few quarters. We do believe that the free cash flow generation in the company should be healthy and thereby, debt should go down.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishit Rathi — CWC Advisors — Analyst,"And Kulin, in your assessment, and I’m not holding you for it, but you guys are taking to become a debt-free company sometime, right? Where would you be — you say that is it two years, three years, where will you be disappointed not getting to that number?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"No, I think that is the stated objective that we are going to generate very healthy cash flows. And as per a three year kind of vision, definitely, we can be very close to being net debt 0.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishit Rathi — CWC Advisors — Analyst,"That is very, very positive. I think you guys have done a really good job from where we were to generating very healthy believe now we are generating a healthy OCF. Just another — this is something that keeps coming up, and I really want to appreciate the fact that now you’re looking at your PAT excluding the minority interest, right? It’s very stark, right, because somehow it appears that Tommy, CK is already a INR100 crore PAT business, right? Is it fair to assume that U.S. Polo will be in a similar kind of range if not better?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"Yes. U.S. Polo, as Shailesh also mentioned is double-digit pre-Ind AS profitability. So it’s in a very healthy profitability and also an extremely healthy return on capital employed.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishit Rathi — CWC Advisors — Analyst,"Yes. It is very, very, very heartening to hear again, because then basically because whenever we look at the stand-alone numbers, excluding the subsidiary numbers, the profitability somehow doesn’t show up but that you’re saying there are two components. One is partially the drag of some of the brands which are discontinued and partially as some of your brands like Arrow scaled up then the true profitability of U.S. Polo at some point of time starts showing up, right?",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"Yes, definitely.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishit Rathi — CWC Advisors — Analyst,Thank you so much.,ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Kulin Lalbhai — Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director,"I mean, we’re already seeing it. I mean 190 bps increase in Q4, every quarter, you will — you should expect to see the operating leverage continue.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD 
Nishit Rathi — CWC Advisors — Analyst,"No. I think you guys have — I think this quarter — I think this year is, I think with the balance sheet and the cash flow and managing all of that, with all that discipline to manage the growth was great. Looking forward to next year, I hope the only thing now left to see is healthy, healthy FCF generation and we’re hoping to see, I am sure we [Indecipherable] Thanks for the time guys.",ARVINDFASN,ARVIND FASHIONS LTD

Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to KRBL Limited Q4 and FY ’23 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,"I now hand the conference over to Mr. Ashish Jain, Chief Financial Officer of KRBL Limited. Thank you, and over to you, sir.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Michelle, and thank you everyone on the call for joining us. Welcome to the Q4 and FY ’23 earnings conference call for analysts and investors of KRBL Limited. Today, we have Mr. Anoop Kumar Gupta, Joint Managing Director; and Ayush Gupta, Head of the Domestic division. Mr. Anil Mittal, who usually joins us on the call, is not available today. So his comments will be read by Mr. Anoop Kumar Gupta.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"To kick-off the call, Mr. Gupta will share the business, industry and overall strategy. Following that, Ayush will delve into the perspectives of our Domestic business. Finally, I will present the financial overview of the company for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ’23.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Once the management has concluded their opening remarks, we will open the floor for an interactive Q&A session. Please note that some of the statements made during the call may contain forward-looking information and actual results may differ from these statements. For more details, you can refer to KRBL’s investor presentation, which is available on the stock exchange website and our company’s website.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Now, I’d like to invite Anoopji to share his views, and the floor is yours.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"Dear investors, good afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I’ll be giving you an overview of the global rice scenario and then focus on the Indian rice industry, and we further focus on the basmati rice industry in India. Thereafter, I will discuss about the KRBL-specific developments and updates.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"The world rice production in the marketing year ’22-’23 is now forecasted at 512.6 million tonnes, which is 2.4% below the 2021 all-time peak of 525.1 million tonnes. The shortfall of 12.5 million tonne in global production is mainly due to lower production in China, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nigeria. The global rice trade, which had dealt a high of 56 million tonne in the year ’21-’22 has come down to 53.6 million tonnes this year due to inclusive measures from countries such as India, who have banned the export of 100% non-basmati broken rice and implemented an export duty of 20% or non-basmati white rice. Such measures have restricted exports to African countries and China, who are the major importers of broken rice from India.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"Shifting focus on the Indian rice industry, India is expected to record rice production of 130.8 million metric tonne in marketing year ’22-’23, which includes 2022 kharif crop and 2023 rabi crop. The basmati production from marketing year ’22-’23 is around 9.5 million tonne, around 12% higher than last year. Despite overall increase in rice production in India in both basmati and non-basmati segments, we have seen a general price increase this year during the crop cycle, which indicates growing demand for both basmati rice and non-basmati rice from India.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"India’s basmati export has grown 16% in volume terms and 46% in value terms in FY ’23 over FY ’22. Volume growth mainly comes from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Yemen, Oman, Qatar, USA, UK and Jordan, whereas India’s total rice exports grew by 6% to record volumes of 2.34 million tonnes and 24% in value terms to INR89,689 crores, accounting for nearly 42% of the global rice trade.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"The main reason for the increase in basmati rice prices were expectation of lower crop on account of unseasonal rains, limited carryover stocks were liquidated because of high prices, historically high export and domestic demand, historically high prices in Pakistan perhaps because of [Indecipherable], reduction in freight rates, rupee’s appreciation, high wheat prices.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"The international wholesale rate have come down to one-third of the level that was seen two years back. The main reason has been simple availability of empty containers and vessels due to normalization and movement of goods across the world. Further, the delays and holdups at the various ports around the world due to lockdown measures have considerably eased up, leading to a faster turnaround time for the vessel, and hence an increase in supply of equipment. Many shipping lines have added a huge number of containers to their inventory and added new vessels to their fleet.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"Talking about the future outlook of rice industry for the year 2024 as per the latest USDA estimate, global rice production is expected to be around 520 million metric tonne in crop marketing year ’23-’24. Global rice consumption is expected to reach 523 million metric tonnes in ’23-’24 from 521 million metric tonnes in ’22-’23. As per the latest USDA estimates, India’s rice production of marketing year ’23-’24 may touch 133 million metric tonnes, while India’s basmati rice production may touch 10 million metric tonnes.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"The basmati production is expected to be higher in terms of take rate as basmati prices have been very buoyant consecutively for past two years and farmers have been very happy with the prices they have been getting for the produce. But the main factor, which has the highest impact on the production of rice, is the weather. While IMD has forecasted a normal monsoon, climate estimates are below-average monsoon owing to El Nino. Although all these estimates are very preliminary and they are subject to change as we come closer to the sowing period, but India faced El Nino in 2014 and 2018 and, in both the years, the staple green production was unaffected. Hence, we feel that the impact of El Nino will be weak.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"Now, the KRBL financial performance. KRBL recorded highest ever annual consolidated performance. Total revenue is of INR5,456 crores, EBITDA is INR1,031 crores, PAT is INR701 crores. Our exports revenue of INR331 crores in quarter four ’23 against INR280 crores in quarter four ’22. FY ’23 export of INR1,931 crores as against INR1,451 crores in FY ’22.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"Key export destination include INR532 crores from UAE, which includes INR375 crores unbranded, INR414 crores from Saudi Arabia, INR242 crores from China, INR117 crores from Australia and other countries also. And there’s an update on expansion. The Gujarat plant is expected to go live by June ’23, that is the next 15, 20 days. Karnataka, the land acquisition has been completed and the civil work has already been started. Madhya Pradesh, the land is identified, the token money has been given and due diligence is going on in process.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"With this, I take over the — I give to Ayush Gupta [Technical Issues] domestic remarks.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","Thank you, and good afternoon. I will now share an update on the performance of the India business. India business clocked INR932 crores in revenue in quarter four financial year ’23, which is a 38% increase in value year-over-year. With this, the India full year revenue grew at 26% in value to close at INR3,335 crores.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","The year marked a new high for KRBL with our portfolio crossing a household penetration of 1 crore households landmark with an 11.5% increase against the package basmati penetration growth rate of only 2.5%. This year also has been recognized as the world’s number one basmati rice brand, which further reinforces our global leadership position in the category.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","Further, maintaining its market leadership position in India across channels, KRBL clocks a volume share of 32.5% in traditional trade in this quarter, while Modern Trade registered a higher server market share of 58% in the quarter. During the quarter, KRBL has expanded its numeric distribution by 75 basis points on [Indecipherable] basis to 45.7% with availability in 2.3 lakh outlets. We have also been driving our Unity brand as a value for money offering, which today stands at INR750 crores plus in the KRBL portfolio with a 50% growth over last year. This GST rationalization measure implemented from mid of the financial year has given the HoReCa business strong tailwind with a healthy 28% volume growth in the full year.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","I will now touch upon some of the key focus areas for our growth journey ahead. In our earlier investor calls, I had outlined our source of growth as loose basmati rice which contributes close to 65% of the total consumption of basmati in India. This presents a huge headroom for growth for KRBL in the domestic business. And being the category captain, we are unlocking the growth opportunity through strategic interventions. Consumer communication is one of the critical levers to drive the harbor change. And in this financial year, we have pivoted our communication and media strategy around this.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","Starting quarter three, our new advertising campaign, Basmati rice in no compromise, featuring the popular Bollywood actor Pankaj Tripathi has gone live with huge impact and partnerships on lead programs like Master Chef, Big Boss and Indian Idol. Secondly, continued distribution expansion up to 50,000 plus population towns is going to be a critical driver for sustainable business growth. We are working in a focused manner to expand retail footprint through manpower investments, implementing FMCG best practices to enhance the coverage and to have better controls in the market.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","The next important lever of growth is innovation and premiumization. One of the most important intervention from our stable this year has been the launch of a diabetic-friendly low GI rice. India being the diabetic capital of the world with 77 million diabetics, we believe that this product offering, we are solving for a very — we are solving for a very important unmet need of the Indian rice consumer and this has huge potential to scale up in the coming few years. In line with our premiumization agenda, we are also in a very focused manner looking to scale up our flagship variant India Gate Classic and building higher penetration at the retail and household front, especially on special occasions.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","Lastly, a key growth lever is the intervention of addressing our total addressable market from INR15,000 crores to INR35,000 crores with our foray into regional rices. Anchored under our master brand India Gate, Sona Masoori, Golden [Indecipherable] and Kolam rice have been launched in the market and are garnering good response. We have already crossed the milestone mark of INR100 crores in the financial year ’23 in the regional rice category.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","One other important thing expected to come for our business is the introduction of the new basmati standards by FSSAI with effect August 1, 2023. Over the years, due to mass commercialization, there is a significant amount of adulterated basmati available in trade, making the prime objective of this regulation to safeguard the integrity of the grain and maintain authenticity of flavor and taste. This regulation will have a number of positive impacts within domestic business scenario.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","First, increased literacy within the trade and subsequently consumer on basmati quality. Second, eradication of players indulging in unfair business as basmati adulteration practices, leading to consolidation of market share amongst our branded players. And third, an accelerated shift from loose and unregulated basmati to packaged and regulated basmati. We see this as a watershed moment for the industry and expect this to be a significant growth driver in the coming years.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","With this, I come to the end of my remarks, and I will now hand it over to Ashish, who will take us through the financial performance.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Ayush. I will now take you through performance for the quarter and year ended March 31st ’23. All figures mentioned by me would be for the consolidated financials of KRBL.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Total income for the quarter stood at INR1,323 crores, marking a growth of 23% over the corresponding quarter last year. The revenue from operations grew by 30%, while other income in the quarter increased by more than 5 times on account of interest on income tax refund. Domestic revenue, as Ayush mentioned, increased by 38% over the corresponding quarter last year to INR932 crores. Year-on-year Basmati sales increased by 43%, driven by 18% growth in volume and 22% growth in basmati realization.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"On the export side, revenue increased by 18% over the corresponding quarter to INR331 crores. Branded basmati sales increased by 11%, though overall basmati sales were flattish in value terms owing to no bulk basmati sales during the quarter. Total basmati sales volume declined by 14% on a year-on-year basis, but was offset by 19% increase in realization. The decline, like I mentioned, in volume was also because there were no bulk basmati sales during the quarter.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Total value of goods dispatched during the year, but their revenue yet to be recognized pending receipt of payment at the end of the quarter was at INR441 crores. This is the number as of March 31, ’23 as against INR216 crores as of March ’22. A significant portion of this is expected to be recognized as revenue in quarter one ’24. Gross margin in the quarter was at 26.5% and was affected by a couple of factors, one of them is higher basmati unit costs and higher share of bulk non-basmati sale in exports. So, basmati — non-basmati sale was at 11% of rice sales in quarter four as against 7% of rice sales in the same quarter last year.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Finally, for non-basmati sales, there was a contract which was canceled by the customer and goods had to be diverted to another country, and therefore, resulted in lower realization. So these three factors, which is higher unit basmati cost as compared to same quarter last year, higher share of bulk non-basmati sale in exports and lower realization on a bulk non-basmati sale resulted in the gross margin.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"EBITDA margin for the quarter was at 14% as against 17% in the corresponding quarter. The margin is lower primarily on account of trend in gross margin and a INR10 crore additional expense on the non-basmati deal, which I just mentioned. Finance cost for the quarter was at INR7.8 crores as against INR3.9 crores on account of higher inventory-led working capital borrowing and higher interest rates. PAT for the quarter was at INR118 crores or 8.9% PAT margin as against INR109 crores or 11% in the corresponding quarter. The number is lower on account of the factors that I mentioned and also because the effective tax rate in the quarter is higher as there was a MTM-related loss setoff, which is not eligible in the taxable income. So in short, our taxable income was higher than the reported PBT, which resulted in higher tax.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"I will now share an analysis of quarter four versus the preceding quarter, so quarter four ’23 versus quarter three ’23. Revenue from operations in quarter four was at INR1,280 crores as against INR1,536 crores. The lower revenue is on account of domestic sales, which were lower vis-a-vis the preceding quarter by INR64 crores and export sales, which are lower by INR194 crores. Domestic basmati volume in quarter four was lower as compared to Q3 as Q3 is festive season, while export volume in Q4 was also lower because no bulk basmati export was done in quarter four.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Quarter four gross margin is lower than that in quarter three on account of higher share of low margin basmati sales as compared to the preceding quarter, higher share of non-basmati sales, which was at 11% of total rice sales in quarter four as against 3% in quarter three, a 2.3% higher average basmati COGS as compared to quarter three, while EBITDA margin was also affected by these factors besides INR10 crores additional cost on the non-basmati deal that I mentioned. Overall, adjusting for these factors, the trend in branded basmati sales remain strong as Anoopji and Ayush have mentioned.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Now, I will discuss FY ’23 performance. Total income for the period stood at a record INR5,456 crores, marking a growth of 28% against FY ’22. Revenue from operations was at INR5,363 crores, a growth of 27%. Gross profit of the company increased by 40% and EBITDA by 46% and PAT by 53% respectively. Domestic basmati sales volume, as Ayush had mentioned, grew by 6%, while realization improved by 26%. On the export side, in FY ’23, basmati sales volume were marginally lower by 2% because of lower bulk exports, although the realization improved by 38%. In FY ’23, overall basmati sales volume for the company improved by 4%, while realization improved by 29%.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Moving on to the balance sheet highlights. Total inventory as of March 31, ’23 was at INR4,186 crores, comprising INR1,616 crores of paddy as against INR869 crores of paddy in March ’22 and INR2,396 crores of rice as against INR1,800 crores of rice inventory in March ’22. In volume terms, paddy stocks were approximately 407,000 tonnes and rice at approximately 404,000 tonnes. These numbers are 256,000 tonnes and 382,000 tonnes respectively in March ’22. Inventory is higher primarily to meet the higher expected demand. Total bank debt as of March 31, ’23 was at INR138 crores as against INR6 crores as on March 31, ’22 due to higher inventory.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Just had an update on the outcome of the Board meeting with respect to distribution of surplus to shareholders. The Board discussed various options to repatriate surplus funds and have sought professional opinion in this respect, post which final decision will be taken. This is expected to be completed in the next four to six weeks.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"With that, I come to an end of my prepared remarks. I will now hand over to the moderator for opening the Q&A session. I would just like to mention that the ED matter is sub judice. So we will not be in a position to respond to queries on that matter. So, over to the moderator now.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,Questions and Answers:,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,"Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] We have the first question from the line of Himanshu Upadhyay from O3 PMS. Please go ahead.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 Capital — Analyst,Hello?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, we can hear you.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 Capital — Analyst,"Yeah. So my first question was, what we hear from various consumer companies is that consumer demand is low and upgrading is not happening, especially at the middle class and lower middle class level. We have a very large inventory at this point of time. In such a scenario, can you give some of your thoughts that the bullishness what we have is usually in domestic market or exports market? And are we able to get our gross margins in absolute value terms per unit increasing for basmati rice even in Q4 in the domestic market because non-basmati is also a bigger proportion of our revenue and exports, it is difficult to really understand how successful we are on the branded side to transfer the pricing.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. Himanshu, thank you for the question. See, on the consumer front, the pressures and the inflationary pressures that you’re talking about, for basmati rice I think these behaviors are quite muted because majority of basmati rice consumptions are happening in metros and Tier 1 towns of the country. And rural and Tier 2 towns are a very small portion of the overall basmati rice contribution. So, on the overall trade, the impact of this is quite minimal for a branded player firstly and then also for basmati rice as a category.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Secondly, on the stock front, the stock position that we carry, that is for both export and domestic, I would say, quite equally. So it’s not that we have a leverage or stock position for any particular…",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"And I would like to add that we are holding stock at a very comfortable position. I mean, the valuation, when you talk of the margins, given the stock valuation, what we are holding is very, very comfortable, so margins are not under pressure.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 Capital — Analyst,"Okay. And secondly, again, the question was on HoReCa distributor in Saudi Arabia. Last call, we stated that we should be able to come from the distribution of the agreement there. Are we done with it? And how did that market perform for us with the new distributors, then that to do what we were doing in the earlier days, but there is still some gap to fill in Saudi Arabia market?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah. HoReCa is still not done, but the present distribution is not back to the same, but we are going. I mean, we are expecting that it will be done in next one or two quarters.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","So, just to add to what Anoopji said, I think if you look at our value sales to Saudi, they are roughly 2 times the number that we had in FY ’22, right? So the distributor is performing on expected lines, but we expect the next year to be better.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And one more thing. This is on slide fixed, okay, here we have said that the margins were under pressure because of some contracts which got canceled. But was it such a big contract because on nearly more than INR1,000 crores of revenue for nearly INR1,300 crores for the quarter, the margin got impacted you are saying?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,No. So I’ll explain. So that was one of the factors. I think you are referring to the reason why the margin is lower in quarter four as compared to the same quarter last year.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 Capital — Analyst,Yeah.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So, I think, like I had mentioned in my speech a couple of things happened. So if you look at year-on-year basis, when we look at our average cost of goods sold for basmati, on a year-on-year basis for the quarter, the basmati comps increased by 24%, while the realization increased for basmati by 17%. So to that extent, the cost increase has been higher. I think this is also partly because the product mix of goods sold in quarter four was — comprise a higher share of lower-margin SKUs. So that is what is reflecting in the margin. Second, on the non-basmati deal that we had explained, so you are right, it was not a large contract. Yes, it was roughly the revenue size, the original revenue size was at INR100 crores. However, the deal got canceled and the goods have to be diverted to another country, which resulted in a lower realization.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Second, there were some additional expenses related to moving the goods from one country to the other and then storing them till the sale happen. So, while not a large contract, but this is an additional cost that we incurred in the quarter, which is what is reflected in the margin.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. I’ll join back in the queue. One small thing, [Indecipherable] we are still doing or we have stopped that completely because we don’t find any mention now.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,Quinoa is still available in the market. It’s available and it’s doing good. It’s growing year-over-year…,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 Capital — Analyst,Okay. Thank you then. I’ll join back in the queue.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Siddhant [Phonetic] from Goodwill. Please go ahead.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Siddhant — Goodwill — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. I think my first question regarding dividend was answered. Like, any reason why you have not declared it right now and four to six weeks later?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So I’ll just explain. So at this time, the Board looked at various options that are available to repatriate surplus funds. We discussed various options, but the Board wanted a professional opinion to be taken. So we are in the process of taking that. We’ll come back and present it to the Board and we are hoping that this entire exercise will be concluded in the next four to six weeks. So in short it’s just evaluating various options, which is why it was not declared this quarter.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Siddhant — Goodwill — Analyst,Okay. So deciding between a buyback and the dividend essentially?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,All options are on the table.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Siddhant — Goodwill — Analyst,"Okay. And my second question is relatively a follow-up, like debt to equity used to be around one to one towards — in the last five years, we lowered it to one is to — at a lower ratio. But now because we have essentially no debt, including no working — barely any working capital loans, our ROEs are getting suppressed. So any sort of financial gearing or something that the company is looking at or are we staying away from debt?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"No. So, see, you are right. I mean, as we speak today, there is very minimal reliance on debt. In fact, where we are today, we have no debt on the company’s balance sheet. So I think the question really is on what is the company’s plan to utilize these funds. So one is, I think a couple of things that we need to keep in mind. One is we are in the process of setting up three new plants, which will then require additional inventory, for this funding will be required. Second is that we constantly look at acquisitions. So while there’s nothing in the finalization stage, there is some amount of funding that will be needed at all. And whatever is remaining after that, I think that’s what the Board is looking at in terms of what’s the best way to return it to the shareholders.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Siddhant — Goodwill — Analyst,"Okay, perfect. Thank you.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amit Aggarwal from Leeway Investments. Please go ahead.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Amit Aggarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Good afternoon. My question regarding broken rice. Exporting broken rice to China. So, what is the total amount of broken rice that has been exported in this financial year?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,I’m sorry to interrupt.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Amit Aggarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,And [Technical Issues] government ban affecting our business for broken rice?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"Sorry, Amit, we can’t hear you clearly.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,"Mr. Aggarwal, I would request you to kindly use your handset if possible, please.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Amit Aggarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Okay. We have been exporting our broken rice to China. So what is the amount of — total amount of broken rice that has been exported in this financial year? And the government ban, are they affecting our top line because of broken rice?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Amit, we don’t generally share country-specific revenue numbers.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,INR242 crores revenue from China.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,Yeah. But I think Anoopji has mentioned that total revenue from China was about INR240 crores in the year.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Amit Aggarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"So, broken rice was exported to China only or some other country also?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,Primarily to China.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Amit Aggarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"And my second question is regarding the realization of the basmati rice in domestic market. Sir, the company has been saying that 17% is the — more realization has been happened in the same particular year. But if you compare the retail tax pricing of Basmati Classic or some other categories, the change has been 9% to 10% per annum. So how does the value coming to 17%?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"I think the question is that the change in Classic price [Technical Issues] 9%, while we are saying that the realization is 10%. So how has that happened?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. Himanshu, see, basmati — India Gate Classic is a very small portion of our overall sales volume and portfolio mix. So while India Gate Classic price increase would have only been 9% to 10%, there are other products in the portfolio which have increased in high double-digits, maybe 20%, 25%. So the net average realization is 75% — 17% on the overall domestic business, certain product categories would have moved accordingly to consumer behavior and other factors.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Amit Aggarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"So, is there any more scope of raising the prices further or I think so stable at this point?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"See, being a consumer-oriented retail product, we try to maintain prices as stable as possible. But looking at the commodity markets, we will keep evaluating our realization accordingly.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Amit Aggarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,And the last question regarding [Technical Issues]. So now we’ve deposited INR190 crores [Technical Issues] and we have got the interest. Have we got this one back or is it still pending with the government?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"No, for that — for those particular years, in that case, we’ve received all the funds back from the government.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Amit Aggarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,So there’s no refund that need to be accounted for?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"On that particular matter, yes. There may be other refund pertaining to other financial years, but on that matter, we received all the refund.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Amit Aggarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,Okay. Thank you.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Soumen Choudhury from Jet Age Securities Private Limited. Please go ahead.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Soumen Choudhury — Jet Age Securities Private Limited — Analyst,"Good afternoon, sir, and thank you for the opportunity. Sir, this quarter, we saw a significant decline in export revenue from the last couple of quarters that we have seen, whereas one would have thought that one should have got the benefit of Ramadan also. So, is there any particular reason why this has happened and what is the outlook on this going forward?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So, as I had explained in my speech, as of March 31, we had about INR440 crores of exports that were dispatched, but the revenue is pending recognition. Now, if you look at the same period last quarter, this number was around INR220 crores. So, as you are aware, we recognize revenue only once the payments are received. So, this additional revenue, most of this INR440 crores will be recognized in quarter one. So if you look at export sales across quarter four and quarter one, you will find that the trend is being maintained. So, I think it’s a timing difference that has happened in case of exports.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Soumen Choudhury — Jet Age Securities Private Limited — Analyst,"So, are we looking at a decent increase over last year, say, if we look at for the year as a whole, are we looking at a significant improvement in volumes and revenue in terms of exports in this year?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"I mean, if you look at quarter one, I mean, you would recall that our exports in quarter three were at roughly above INR500 crores. So, we are hoping that in quarter one, which is the current quarter, we will come back to that level.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Soumen Choudhury — Jet Age Securities Private Limited — Analyst,"Okay. And just one small thing on realizations. If we compare like-to-like, would realizations have been slightly higher in Q4 vis-a-vis Q3 in exports? As for basmati pre as we say?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"No, very similar levels, no significant increase vis-a-vis Q3.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Soumen Choudhury — Jet Age Securities Private Limited — Analyst,Okay. And domestic also?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,Yes.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Soumen Choudhury — Jet Age Securities Private Limited — Analyst,"Okay. Okay, fine. That’s it from my side. Thank you.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kush Gangar from Care PMS. Please go ahead.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Kush Gangar — Care PMS — Analyst,"Hi. My question was on exports. So, for exports, as we have seen exports have been a pain point since the last few years and have been [Technical Issues]. Even in this quarter, you mentioned that some of impact would be transferred to Q1. But then if INR200 crores, which could have come in Q4, gets transferred to Q1, it means Q1 is already lower versus our current trend rate. So, can you [Technical Issues] sustainable growth or run rate for export for the next one or two years?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So I will just give a short-term view and then a slightly longer-term view. See, as you know, part of our exports also include bulk exports. So — and that tends to be lumpy. So you may have quarters in which there is significant bulk exports and then you may have a quarter like Q4, where it doesn’t happen. So first, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, that’s primarily the reason why you will see export revenue moving. However, from a longer-term perspective, when we look at both elements of export, one is both branded as well as bulk, I think we see the outlook as bright, whereas as Anoopji has also mentioned, I think we’re continuing to see strong basmati demand from countries both for the package as well as non-basmati space.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Kush Gangar — Care PMS — Analyst,"Right, okay. And what would be the mix of bulk in exports? Can you share that?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. On an annual basis, we do about INR800 crores to INR900 crores of bulk exports. So although the current year revenue of, let’s say, roughly INR5,400 crores, about INR800 crores to INR900 crores is bulk.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Kush Gangar — Care PMS — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. As was mentioned earlier, I think Saudi, our initial — before the business went down, our run rate was INR1,000 crores plus, I think. And Anoopji — Anilji had mentioned that in a year or two, we hope to reach that figure. So are we confident from current INR400-something crore…",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. Yeah. So I’ll just give a little bit of overview. See, I mentioned that if you look at our Saudi sales in FY ’23, they were 2 times that of FY ’22. However, you are right. I think there is — we are yet to come back to the earlier revenue mark. And I think our estimate is that in FY ’24, we should get there. So it’s in the right direction, but still not where it was earlier.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Kush Gangar — Care PMS — Analyst,"And our earlier is about INR1,000 crores [Technical Issues]?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,That’s right.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Kush Gangar — Care PMS — Analyst,Okay. Okay. Thank you. And the reason for other income being quite high?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So quarter four, other income includes an interest on income tax refund to the tune of about INR44 crores. That’s why the number is high.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Kush Gangar — Care PMS — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. Okay. And this is the second quarter where we have seen a very strong domestic performance, considering all the points highlighted. So are we confident that this has become a base now and we should in spite of all the weakness in demand, etc, this has become the base now and we should say, came up quite significantly even from current higher level?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. Definitely, I think our domestic business, as I mentioned in my remarks also, has been seeing good tailwinds, both in the bulk pack segment as well as the consumer pack segment. Our communication strategies, our distribution strategies are all working well. Brand penetrations are doing good, consumer demand as well. So what we have achieved in the last two quarters has now become the base for us and we’ll be looking forward to build on it quarter-on-quarter.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Kush Gangar — Care PMS — Analyst,Great. Thank you. That’s helpful.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Varun Bang from Bryanston Investments. Please go ahead.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Varun Bang — Bryanston Investments — Analyst,"[Technical Issues] from unbranded to branded. So, first question is on modern trade. So this is the fastest-growing channel for us. So how is the profitability and pricing in the modern trade relative to traditional trade? And do we see any challenges in maintaining profitability in this channel given the dominance and purchasing power this segment has?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Frankly — thank you, Varun, for the question. Modern trade and e-commerce channel actually for us is more profitable if I compare the overall P&L account because expenses are quite less compared to general trade. So, in general trade, we will have a lot of manpower and expenses to cater to that wide spectrum of retailers. But in modern trade because of the consolidation of supply chain and other effects, our cost tends to be lower. Also, modern trade and e-commerce, this category of staples is, I would say, crowd-pullers or footfall drivers really. So these channels also invest heavily on these particular categories. So the cost of doing business to sum it up is lower compared to general trade.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Varun Bang — Bryanston Investments — Analyst,"Okay. And you’ve talked about densifying distribution reach. So, can you quantify how many distributors and retail touchpoints we have added during the year? And we said we’ve reached 3.31 lakh outlets in traditional trade. So, basis of acceptability, affordability and kind of stores that we target, roughly how many number of outlets can keep and sell branded basmati rice in India?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So this year, we’ve expanded our distribution network quite aggressively and to a number of 40% to reach 750-plus distributor mark — dealers and distributors. So we have now 750-plus distributors and dealers in the India market. And on the outlet front, the current penetration of packaged basmati in India is about 7 lakh outlets. And as a brand, we are available in about 3.3 lakh outlets. So, our objective right now is to obviously reach to a 60% to 65% mark of retail penetration. But eventually, our objective would also be to push the 7 lakh number of the category to 1 million number in the next few years.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Varun Bang — Bryanston Investments — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. And typically, what I’ve seen is, in rice typically, there is a fixed per kg spread that we charge. Is it a similar way, do we price our package basmati rice, or is it a fixed percentage that we mark up? So if you can just comment on how we drive consumer packs and bulk packs, that would be helpful.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division",You’re talking about modern trade or are you talking about general?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Varun Bang — Bryanston Investments — Analyst,"Overall, in general.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","So, pricing for the consumer packs and basmati in the segment is quite market-driven, I would say. Based on consumer affordability at various price points, we’ve got products right from India Gate Classic to India Gate Mini Mogra 2. So that spectrum of products cater to all types of consumer demand, needs and price points. And that becomes the basis of our product offering. But then compared to the blends and commodity prices, we keep on simulating this…",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,[Indecipherable] 20% margin for the retailer.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
"Ayush Gupta — Head, Domestic Division","Yeah. On the MRP, retailer gets about a 20% margin on our products. So that’s also a norm that we follow.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Varun Bang — Bryanston Investments — Analyst,Okay. So it’s a fixed percentage markup what we look at?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So, Varun, I think what Ayush — just to add to what Ayush is saying, in the rice market for basmati, there is a clear ladder in terms of various price points. I mean, India Gate as a brand is present on all the price points. And this has a very wide range. I mean, you can have the retail price of INR200 a kg for Classic and then going down to INR40 or INR60. From a pricing point of view, one is, we make sure that we are available on all these price points, make sure that retailer gets a 20% margin. I think, finally, your question is that what is the impact of commodity prices in this? So, see, any staple brand is never immune from the commodity price, but we try to maintain the price as much as possible so that there is stability for the consumer.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Varun Bang — Bryanston Investments — Analyst,"No, that’s not my question. I mean, my question is, I mean, do we look at a fixed trade that we charge on a per kg basis or is it a percentage per kg that we look at?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Percentage, not fixed. Percentage.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Varun Bang — Bryanston Investments — Analyst,Okay. Okay. That is what I wanted to understand. Thank you.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Anuj Sharma from M3 Investment. Please go ahead.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anuj Sharma — M3 Investment — Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you for this opportunity. And just going back to this question on margin. See, what I understand is since we have been holding inventory and I think the pricing have been on an uptick and ignoring the other two factors, how does it work that in quarter three, we could have a high margin and the cost certainly becomes high in quarter four? How does the calculation work? Just could you explain the model?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So, I think — I mean, the answer really lies in two things. One is that the profile of our sales in quarter four. So if you look at the sales of higher-margin SKUs, that was at — in volume terms, that was at 71% in quarter three, while in volume terms, it was up 54% in quarter four. So that will have its own consequent impact on the gross profit margin.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Second factor, which I’ve explained was that there are — we had lower-than-usual realization on a non-basmati deal because goods had to be moved to another country and sold there. So that is the second factor affecting gross profit margin. The third is that from other — you would see that there are additional other expenses, which is also coming from the non-basmati that we have. So these three things together is what has really affected margin. These factors were not present in quarter three, number one. Number two, the overall volume of sale, including exports was much higher in quarter three. So these few things need to be looked at together.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anuj Sharma — M3 Investment — Analyst,"Okay. But just on an inventory, we follow first-in first-out model, is that correct?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. Actually, I’d just like to give a different perspective on your question as well. So, between our quarter three and quarter four, there is a part of sales that is what we call it aged rice or raw aged rice sale. So obviously, that inventory is what we carried from the year previous to that. And our inventory cost would be quite stagnant on that. But there’s a big portion of sales that happened in quarter three and quarter four, which is new crop, which is the parboiled rice and the steam rice. For those — because it’s new crop and, as you know, the crop season this year, the prices were quite high. So, our input costs on the raw material was quite high. So that would be an effect between quarter three and quarter four that you see would be an impact on margins.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anuj Sharma — M3 Investment — Analyst,"Okay. So, one last question. What is the visibility you have or it’s a very volatile, you can have a 8% margin and then a 22% margin. So, what is the visibility you have? And let’s suppose you foresee that it will be a low margin quarter, do you stop that, you only plan that we’ll have only 20-plus percent margin or it’s a uncertain scenario as to how does it play out next quarter and next year? How much certainty do you have in this margin grade?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So, I think — see, one is that just from a business principle point of view, we really don’t engage in any trade or any product sales which gives less than 15% to 16% margin, right? So directionally, all business is planned with that benchmark as the minimum margin. Now, you are right, from a quarter-on-quarter, there may be variance. One of these factors that causes variance is the quantum of bulk sales, especially export sale, where we have limited predictability in terms of when that revenue will get recognized. However, overall, what we aim for is that during the year, we maintain the margin in the 17% to 18% trajectory.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anuj Sharma — M3 Investment — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. And one last, in terms of pricing trends, can you just highlight how has been the pricing and what is the outlook on pricing going forward? This is the finished or maybe — or the raw material, both could help?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"No, we are expecting the new season in the month of October, November. Now, the pricing are quite stagnant and in the new season, we think the prices will come down definitely.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anuj Sharma — M3 Investment — Analyst,"Okay. And despite that, we would want to have one of the highest ever inventory despite…",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"In the aged rice, I have told many times that aged rice is a different thing than a new rice. Aged rice has its own premium.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anuj Sharma — M3 Investment — Analyst,"Sure. So, I’m saying, the incremental inventory, I understand the aged rice, but we have built up inventory. And if we are expecting a price reduction…",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anoop Kumar Gupta — Joint Managing Director,"So that will all be aged rice, it will have a premium. There’s no problem.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Anuj Sharma — M3 Investment — Analyst,All right. Thank you.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Jigar Upadhyay from Antigo Consultants Private Limited [Phonetic]. Please go ahead.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Jigar Upadhyay — Antigo Consultants Private Limited — Analyst,"Thank you for the opportunity, and my congratulations to the management for a good set of numbers. Sir, I have some very broad questions in terms of the overall, the volume, I mean, how it has played in terms of the India volumes and the export volume? And how do we look at the margin when one wants to model it? Is it on a — are you — do you track margins on a per tonne basis? And if yes, I mean, how do — what is the benchmark margin that you look at?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. So, the EBITDA margin range that we look at is a minimum of 17% to 18%. So that’s what we are looking to achieve through the year. Now like I explained in the previous answer, now quarter-to-quarter, this may vary because there is a lumpiness in the nature of bulk exports. But however, over the year, you can expect the 17% to 18% margin to be maintained.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Jigar Upadhyay — Antigo Consultants Private Limited — Analyst,"Right, right. And would the margin for the export business be higher than the domestic?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Somewhat. However, the reason is that the realization tends to be higher, but then the product mix is also different. So typically, it may be around 5% higher than the domestic business.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Jigar Upadhyay — Antigo Consultants Private Limited — Analyst,"Understood, sir. And what would be the realization for domestic and exports broadly?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,You’re talking about quarter four?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Jigar Upadhyay — Antigo Consultants Private Limited — Analyst,"I mean, even an overall picture for FY ’23 would be fine.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, if you look at overall basmati realization in the domestic market, that was at around INR74,000 per tonne. This is basmati branded for the full financial year FY ’23. The same number for basmati branded in export was 130,000 tonnes — INR1,30,000 per tonne.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Jigar Upadhyay — Antigo Consultants Private Limited — Analyst,"Generally, the realization is — okay, got it. And this is to — I mean, the export part is still branded?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,Yes. So both numbers are for branded.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Jigar Upadhyay — Antigo Consultants Private Limited — Analyst,"Got it. And if I may ask lastly, I mean, what would be the overall scale in terms of the volumes for India and exports?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,In terms of our volume sales?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Jigar Upadhyay — Antigo Consultants Private Limited — Analyst,"Yes, in sales volume.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, so domestic basmati branded sales last financial year was at about 3,70,000 tonnes and basmati branded export sale was at around 90,000 tonnes.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Jigar Upadhyay — Antigo Consultants Private Limited — Analyst,"Got it, sir. And we are not into any kind of — I mean, is the traded or private label volume very high or we prefer to focus more on branded?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, given that number that out of roughly INR5,400 crores revenue, bulk export is to the tune of about INR800 crores to INR900 crores.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Jigar Upadhyay — Antigo Consultants Private Limited — Analyst,"Got it, sir. Got it. Thank you.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Hadiam Patwari [Phonetic] from GSM Wealth Advisors [Phonetic]. Please go ahead.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Hadiam Patwari — GSM Wealth Advisors — Analyst,"Hello? Am I audible, sir?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,Yes.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Hadiam Patwari — GSM Wealth Advisors — Analyst,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking up my question. My question is, what is the split of business between basmati and non-basmati in volume terms?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. So if we look at the domestic branded business, like I mentioned, domestic branded basmati volume was at 370,000 tonnes. The non-basmati branded was at about 21,000 tonnes. So 370,000 basmati branded in domestic, 21,000 tonnes non-basmati branded. In exports, basmati branded was at 131,000 — sorry, 88,000 tonnes while non-basmati was small at about 5,000 tonnes.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Hadiam Patwari — GSM Wealth Advisors — Analyst,Okay. That’s it from my side. Thank you for answering the question.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, this would be the last question for today, which is from the line of Praveen from Yes Securities [Phonetic]. Please go ahead.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Praveen — Yes Securities — Analyst,"First of all, congratulations for the good result. So, Mr. Ashish has said about something about some M2M. So I just want to understand what kind of M2M he was discussing. And he has just informed that there is a 44-fold income of interest on income tax refund. So, what kind of refund is this?",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"So, the MTM loss that I was referring to is that, as you know, we mark-to-market our investments. So on that investment portfolio, there was a notional loss of INR3 crores. So, the PBT that we reported was after adjusting for that loss. However, in taxable income, that setoff is not available. So, our taxable income was higher than the reported PBT, which is what resulted in our tax outgo. So, when you take the tax outgo as a percentage of PBT, it appears to be higher than the previous quarter. So that is what I was trying to explain.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"The other income number you are referring to includes interest on income tax refund. So we have made disclosures on this case. But broadly, they were delayed refund from income tax authorities on which we were entitled to interest, which was received and it is recognized as other income.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Praveen — Yes Securities — Analyst,And how much — so your inventory is also mark-to-market or it is as a normal level?,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"We report inventory as lower of cost or NRV, which is net realizable value.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Praveen — Yes Securities — Analyst,"Okay. So, is there any loss sitting in the inventory or it is…",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Ashish Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"No. I mean, on the contrary, as Anoopji had mentioned, the market prices are far higher than our average inventory cost. No loss at all.",KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Praveen — Yes Securities — Analyst,Got it.,KRBL,KRBL Limited 
Operator,"Any further questions, Mr. Praveen?",KRBL,KRBL Limited

Anuj Sonpal — Chief Executive Officer,"Without any further delay, I request Mr. Dharmil A. Bodani to start with his opening remarks. Thank you, and over to you, Dharmil.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"Thank you so much, Anuj, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It is our pleasure to welcome you all to the earnings conference call to discuss the results of the quarter and the financial year ended 31st March, 2023. Thank you for joining us today, once again. I would like to now introduce — request Mr. Girish Khandelwal, our CFO, to give the financial highlights for the quarter and the financial year ended 31st March, 2023. Thank you. Girish, over to you.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, thank you very much, Dharmil. Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to welcome you all for the conference call. I would like to focus on the operating performance of the Company. Let me first take you through our consolidated performance for the quarter. The operating revenue for the quarter was INR195.3 crore, which was a decrease of approximately 3.7% on a year-on year basis and 2.1% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Operating EBITDA reported was INR9.8 crore, decreased as compared to INR14.10 crore in the previous quarter and INR22.10 crore in the corresponding quarter. Operating EBITDA margin stood at 4.76% as compared to 7.07% in the previous quarter. Net profit-after-tax reported was INR1.2 crore, decreased as compared to INR3.8 crore in the previous quarter, and INR10.5 crore in the corresponding quarter, while PAT margins were 0.61%, which was a decrease of about 130 basis points on a quarter-on-quarter basis.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Coming to the FY 2023 performance. On a consolidated basis, the operating revenue was INR849.1 crore, which was a decrease of approximately 2.30% on a year-on-year basis. Operating EBITDA reported was INR54.20 crore, decreased as compared to INR92.5 crore in the corresponding FY ’22. Operating EBITDA margins stood at 6.38%. Net profit-after-tax reported was INR19.70 crore, decreased as compared to INR53.3 crore in the corresponding FY ’22, while PAT margins were 2.32%, which was a decrease of 381 basis points on a year-on-year basis.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"During the year, manufacturing and operating cost has gone up by INR6.82 crore. This is mainly due to increase in the power cost by INR5.46 crore. And if we see — look at the finance cost, so the finance cost has increased by INR8.98 crore due to the higher utilization of working capital borrowings and increase in interest rates as compared to the previous year. Finance cost also includes the forex loss of INR2.09 crore as against the INR0.86 crore in the previous year.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Now, come on the cash flow performance. So the — during the year, cash profit stood at INR39.17 crore, as compared to INR7.31 crore in the previous year. The net operating cash flow was minus INR22.30 crore as [Technical Issues] minus INR0.81 crore in the FY ’22. The decrease in the operating cash flow is mainly driven by the higher cash investment in the working capital requirement. Net debt to equity ratio stood at 0.34 from 0.21 as compared to the previous year FY ’22. RoCE for the FY ’23 stood at 5.32% as compared to 12.5% in the year FY ’22.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you. With this, we can now open the floor for the questions-and-answers session. Over to you, Anuj.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,Questions and Answers:,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you very much, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Ankit Gupta from Bamboo Capital. Please go ahead.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. Sir, can you please talk about how is the demand scenario in aroma chemicals and camphor currently and when do you expect the demand to pick up for these products?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Okay. So Ankit, in terms of — I’ll talk about the camphor. When it comes to camphor in the local market, primarily the fourth quarter is always a bit of a off-season. So we will have to see how the demand picks up in Q1 and Q2 because that’s when the season starts, and I think that’s when the efficiencies of the capacities that have come online will really be tested. So with related to camphor, locally, I think this is a situation where we need to wait and watch. When it comes to the terpene chemicals as well as the specialty aroma ingredients, I think demand in India is stable, but if you look at global demand, the global demand is extremely subdued, primarily driven by the factors like overstocking in supply chains all across the world as well as certain recessionary trends that we are seeing in the European and the American markets. So at least for the next two to three quarters, going forward, I think we feel that the demand will stay a bit soft till we reach some levels of stabilization, because I don’t see a substantial destruction in demand, but I only see a lag that is being created because of the excess stocking in the supply chains.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Sure. So the kind of destruction in margins that we’ve seen in last year, so can that also be attributed to the dumping from China or it was largely to do with demand actually was down?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So I think, again, the reason for — I mean, if you look at the three divisions that we have, our fragrance and flavor division seems to be doing extremely well. I mean, we’ve had close to 50% quarter-on-quarter growth in terms of our production volumes and almost 30% increase in our sales volume. But when it comes to camphor, locally, like I said, that there are a variety of negative factors. The competitive landscape has changed with a lot of new players coming with additional — with new capacity and old players increasing capacity, and all of them primarily coming online in Q3 and Q4, which is relatively softer part of the demand in terms of the year. So going forward, we will have to see what happens, but there is a tremendous pressure on the selling price because of this oversupply of camphor in the market. And globally, be it camphor, be it terpene chemicals or be it specialty aroma ingredients, like I said, that there is a softness in demand. Our customers have — the RFQs that we were allocated for H1, I think they’ve been kind of honored to the extent of between 60% to 70% and the balance have either been postponed or they have been canceled. So I think that kind of puts a pressure because we have a lot of inventory build-up, which is relatively high cost. And so I think, if you put all these factors together, there seems to be a kind of a mixture of a lot of negative factors is they’re putting pressure on the demand, is they’re putting pressure on the sale price and that is impacting profitability as well as top line.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Sure, sure. So my last question was on the capex. For the capex, all the three — the brownfield as well as the greenfield capex written in the presentation that will get completed by end of FY ’24. So post all the capex being completed and the kind of all-in realization that we have seen in aroma chemicals and camphor, what kind of top line can we expect at optimal capacity utilization whenever we reach it, let’s say, in two, three years, what kind of revenue can we generate with all the capacities put together?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,We have always maintained that whatever capex we [Speech Overlap],OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"Parag, I’m sorry to interrupt you. I think this question has been covered in previous call. So if Anuj can intervene, maybe we can — we provided the transcripts. I think we’ve already given an answer to this.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Yeah. Okay, thank you.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,Thank you.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Dhwanil Desai from Turtle Capital. Please go ahead.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dhwanil Desai — Turtle Capital — Analyst,"Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Sir, my first question, Parag, is that we are seeing very subdued demand in aroma chemical, but we have a very large [indecipherable] basket. So are we experiencing this kind of a slowdown across all products. And if so, is it only the inventory part which is playing the role or even the supply side from China has come back strongly and that is what is hurting? Can you throw some light on that?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"So Parag, I’ll take the first part of the question and you can take the second part.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,Sure.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"On the first part of the question, yes, we have a large range of specialty chemicals and generic bulk aroma chemicals. Fragrance or flavor, like, we may not have explained in the past, is a recipe or a formulation. So formulations and recipes use almost — not almost, they use all the ingredients that we manufacture. So the slowdown, if it comes, it comes across the board. So it’s not chemical-specific. It’s the demand of fragrances does slow down, the use of aroma chemicals both bulk and generic do slow down, and therefore, this — the impact is felt across the board. Parag, you can take the second part.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so I think Dharmil has rightly answered that when you look at a fragrance, a fragrance gets created with all these materials, which are the generic specialties as well as the bulk commodities. And definitely, I think the Chinese capacity coming online and the Chinese manufacturers be active after a while plays a role in terms of the ability of the customer to negotiate a little more harder than what they were doing in the past two years. So yes, it makes an impact. Having said that, I think our product development philosophy has always factored the Chinese being very active in a very steady-state of market, and we still able to compete and [indecipherable]. So I think when the demand comes back [Technical Issues].",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,"Sir, sorry to interrupt, but the line for you was a little bad in between. If you could please use the handset or repeat the last line, sir.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,Sure. Is it okay now?,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,"Yes, this is much better, sir.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Okay. So I’m saying that, when it comes to the Chinese, I think in a steady-state of business, our product development philosophy and our product development plan has factored the presence of Chinese competitors and we’ll still be able to co-exist.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dhwanil Desai — Turtle Capital — Analyst,"Second question is, I think for FY ’23, we have guided for around 8% — 8% to 9% kind of a margin, but we ended Q4 with much lower margin. So going forward, given that the demand environment is challenging. Do we expect to have a 10% margin or lower or higher, any guidance on that?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So I think, Dhwanil, to be very honest, in the 25-odd-years that I’ve been in this space, I think we find ourselves in a very unique position where everything is down, where the raw material prices are down, where the demand is down, where the forecasts are down, and the cost of borrowing money is up, so there is a lot of pressure for releasing — generating cash by reducing inventories. So I think it will probably be very challenging to really give you a very definitive answer. I’m sure we are taking all the steps that are possible internally to ensure that. We stay at the maximum profitable level, even in these current situations. And when situation stabilizes, which I’m sure it will over the next two quarters, and when it does, we will be in a position to kind of get at some — at better margins.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dhwanil Desai — Turtle Capital — Analyst,"Okay. One more question, can I ask or?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,"Sir, sorry to interrupt. We request you to please rejoin the queue.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dhwanil Desai — Turtle Capital — Analyst,Sure.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,"Yes, thank you. The next question is from the line of Rajat Setiya from ithoughtpms. Please go ahead.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,Hi. Am I audible?,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,Yes.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, Rajat.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Okay, thanks. So with regards to camphor, you mentioned that there is oversupply that happened. So is it possible to quantify at the industry level, what is this oversupply, how much is this oversupply?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So it’s a bit challenging in terms of quantifying the exact camphor supply and demand because a lot of the new capacities that have added up are not publishing their capacities in the public domain. Having said that, if you look at camphor as a product, it’s not something which is having a phenomenal CAGR growth. So we will — we need to see at the end of this season as to what are these capacities that have come up are really eligible and capable of supplying to the market and the prices at which it is being supplied today, which, according to us, is completely unsustainable and is probably kind of not feasible, so how long can these unsustainable prices be maintain. So I think it’s something which we will probably be in a much better position to evaluate an answer two, three quarters down the line.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Sure. So is this something that you would say that happens every few years, I mean, every few years industry players come up with huge supply because last few quarters were very rewarding? Is this how it is in camphor industry?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So Rajat, I mean, what I feel is I think camphor probably had a good run for the past three to four years. And starting with 2018 when the raw material prices shot up and all the camphor manufacturers in India found themselves in a very sweet spot where we had a lot of low-cost inventory and we were able to pass the price increases to the customers, eventually then led to the steep price of camphor on the street increasing. So I think — and post that, I think camphor was looked upon as a remedy for COVID. So I think the industry had a good run for three to four years. And I think the money or the cash that was accumulated, according to our estimates, has gotten invested in building brand-new capacity of camphor without really having a look at whether it’s sustainable or not from a CAGR perspective. So I think that’s the reason why this is a little different than what it has been in the past. And I think this combined with a global situation where the requirement for pinene is historically down because the aroma ingredients requirement has also come down. So I think there are a lot of factors which are kind of favorable for a price reduction, which have happened altogether. Having said that, I think the current prices that are being offered are absolutely unsustainable, because although there is reduction in the price of alpha pinene. But what has been currently offered in the market is the alpha pinene that probably will be reaching our plants not before September.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Sure, sure. Understood. And like you mentioned, you are saying [Speech Overlap]",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,"Sir, sorry to interrupt. We would request you to please rejoin the question queue if you have further questions.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Sure, thank you.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks. Thanks, Rajat.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,The next question is from the line of Kiran Chheda from Chheda Investment Consultancy. Please go ahead.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Kiran Chheda — Chheda Investment Consultants — Analyst,Hello? Hello?,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, Kiran.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Kiran Chheda — Chheda Investment Consultants — Analyst,"First of all, I was a little surprised that there were no opening comments from Mr. Dharmil this time around. Nevertheless. Sir, [Indecipherable] inventories. The inventories have shot up substantially almost by 30% from the previous year, [indecipherable]. What exactly is the breakup of raw material, work-in process, and finished goods, please?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So I think across the board, be it the raw materials, be it the semi-finished goods, as well as the finished goods, I think we have seen a ramp-up in the inventories, because normally, if you want to run these gigantic plants, you kind of go with a three or four month inventory procurement plan. And hence, I think a lot of your raw materials for four to five months are either they have reached your plant or they are in the shift or they are at the supplier’s side ready to be dispatched. So any course correction in inventory probably will come with a lag of four to five months, and all our inventory procurement happened in October and November 2022 when we received our RFQs for H1 2023. Now, the inventory pile-up has primarily happened because of a lot of our global customers postponing their procurements or procure postponing their allocation, which they have given to us, which has resulted in the inventory piling-up which was planned for them. And apart from that, because of the slowdown in in Europe and America, because of the pile-up of inventories at their end, we are seeing that the spot procurement also has kind of diminished substantially in the quarter that has gone by. So all these factors put together, the outcome is that we are — we have ended up with higher inventories, and I think that kind of is very common currently across the board in our industry.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Kiran Chheda — Chheda Investment Consultants — Analyst,"Sir, it’s almost 5.5 months of annual turnover, that’s really substantial. And when do you think situation could become more like normal?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So I think when it comes to the — like I said, that when it comes to the camphor and terpene chemicals space, we probably will have to kind of wait out at least for the next two to three quarters before we come to know what is exactly going to be the picture. And I think from the feedback that we are getting on our customers and the kind of quantities that we are receiving for the H2 RFQs, we feel that we are another two to three quarters away from some level of stabilization in the aroma — specialty aroma ingredient space as well, whereas I think on the fragrance side, we are seeing a much different story where there’s very strong demand, especially in the markets that we operate and a good support for our products.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"I think, Parag, I would like to intervene here. I think more than strong demand, I want to reiterate that. I think the wins that Oriental Aromatics is getting in the fragrance and flavor area is a lot more. And if you go back to our earlier calls, we would have mentioned to you that we are participating in a lot more projects and this is actually the reason why the fragrance division is growing. I’m not sure whether the industry overall is growing. I think there’s a lot of musical chairs in the business, which is changing from A to B. So our gain in volume and value in the fragrance and flavor division does not necessarily mean that the industry is growing.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Kiran Chheda — Chheda Investment Consultants — Analyst,"All right. Any guidance for the current year, Mr. Dharmil, please?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"In guidance, what guidance?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Kiran Chheda — Chheda Investment Consultants — Analyst,In terms of turnover and the financials.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"I don’t want to, at this point, give a guidance because as Parag has mentioned, we are seeing an unusual drop in prices of raw materials on the chemical side. And the guidance I would like to give you is that it is going to be a challenging next two or three quarters till we see a stabilization.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Kiran Chheda — Chheda Investment Consultants — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Thank you so much.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vijay Karpe from Shriram Life Insurance. Please go ahead.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Yeah, thank you for giving me the opportunity. My question pertains to the camphor industry. So we talked about the oversupply, which is there. So when do we expect this new capacities to be fully absorbed?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"To be very honest, I think these capacities probably have kind of surfaced in the last six months or so. So we will have to first look at their quality and a lot of the other aspects going into the — going forward. I think the kind of numbers that are floating around, because we do not have the exact numbers of the others [indecipherable]. I think there is a significant overcapacity, which will take a while to be absorbed if all of them come online and all of them have to be sold in the market.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Any number that you can put to it, like one year, two years?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I’m not so sure. So that’s the reason why — I mean, I’m sure about my capacity, but I’m not very sure about the capacities of the others, because those are numbers which are flying in the air. So I do not want to make any judgments based on the numbers that I don’t have. But assuming that those numbers are true, it’s much longer than one or two years.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay, great. And the second question is, we supply camphor as a solvent to our end to our clients. So just wanted to understand the percentage of camphor that goes into the end products like your paints, adhesives, toothpaste in terms of volume and value, a rough estimate, if possible?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So Vijay, primarily, I think the camphor application — the biggest application at least in India is in the religious and the praying space. So where it is used directly in the form of a formulated product, like a tablet or a slab. I think the other two applications are in pain management, which is where it is used in certain medicinal products or OTC products where it depends on the formulation, and I’m not privy to that information. And the third application is primarily in cold and flu management where it is used as part of inhalers or — so again, there — I think in terms of the composition that goes there, I’m not very privy to that information. But these are primarily the three applications where camphor is used.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,And what about paints?,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"It’s — to the best of my knowledge, it is not used in paints.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay, okay, yeah. Thank you for answering my questions.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rohit Nagraj from Centrum Broking Limited. Please go ahead.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rohit Nagraj — Centrum Broking Limited — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. Again, delving a little bit on camphor. Just wanted to have an understanding in terms of the growth avenues incrementally from different segments, so including the devotional segment and the traditional as well as the three segments that you talked about. What is the kind of domestic growth rate or global growth rate we are talking about? And an allied question to that, I understand the alpha pinene, beta pinene availability is relatively scarce. So what has changed in terms of availability of the raw material dynamics from a particular geography because of which those newer capacities have come in? Thank you.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. So primarily to answer your question, because there are no formal studies that are done for the increase in the CAGR growth for camphor in the devotional space, again, based on the hearsay that we hear from certain smaller consumer insight study, it’s at a low-digit — low-single-digit CAGR growth. So it’s not a product where there is a substantial growth rate. Having said that, I think there is a healthy double-digit CAGR growth in the pain management and the flu management space, primarily driven by the ability of the world — I mean, the world getting either old or getting more — trying to become more fit by doing more exercise, so more prone to kind of having bruises or kind of pain in the joints. So these are the kind of broadly the numbers that we have when we are doing our internal calculations. I think when it comes to the alpha pinene availability, it’s a very unique commodity where you have a lot of pine trees in the world and they get tapped based on the demand and the supply. And primarily from a demand perspective, alpha pinene gets used primarily in aroma ingredients or in camphor and certain terpene chemicals. And the supply side is normally depending on what is the demand. And since the offtake in — like I mentioned earlier, in aroma ingredients, as well as camphor as well as terpene chemicals is showing a substantial drop. Although the commodity can be considered as scarce when the price goes up. I mean, right now, the commodities available in abundance and so the prices have crashed. It’s more like oil to give you a very loose comparison. It’s a commodity, which is a natural commodity. It can be taken out depending on the demand and that the price of taking out is fixed. So if the demand is there, then it will be taken, otherwise the pine trees are not.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rohit Nagraj — Centrum Broking Limited — Analyst,"Right. That’s good to know. And my second question is in terms of camphor pricing. So just a perspective from maybe past decade or 15 years, how the prices have moved up in terms of the peak prices, trough prices and more stable prices? Thank you.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so I think if the camphor industry, per se, if you look at pre-2021 was a pretty balanced industry where there was no substantial capacity addition and there was no substantial capacity deletion. I think one major change that happened was still around 2018, you had around 4,000 — 3,000 tons of camphor, which used to be imported from China that when the capacities in India increased by just process reengineering or smaller expansions, I think the Indian manufacturers were able to gobble up that particular and so the Chinese imports stopped. But apart from that, I think it was a pretty stable pricing and the main factor for the price increase or drop was the global alpha pinene prices, which were not driven by camphor but which were driven by some other factors like the gum resin prices globally or the demand of alpha pinene in the aroma ingredients space. So if you look at the last 10 to 15 years situation, camphor prices always used to stay stable when the pinene prices were stable, and there was rarely a situation where there was extreme oversupply in the market. I think that’s changed post-2021 when people have really gone ahead and build these capacities. And so the situation is a little different than what it has ever been in the last 10, 15 years.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rohit Nagraj — Centrum Broking Limited — Analyst,"Right. Thanks a lot for answering the questions, and best of luck, sir.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ankit Gupta from Bamboo Capital. Please go ahead.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Thanks for the follow-up. Just wanted to check on the capex. How much capex is left in Baroda, Bareilly and Mahad? And how are we planning to, like, fund that?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So Girish, correct me if I’m wrong.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"Parag, Girish can take this question.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,Correct.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,Girish?,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,Girish?,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, yes, yes. In Baroda, our balance of capex is around, say, INR100 crore, and for that, we are going to take the debt of around INR70 crore, INR75 crores. And for Mahad, our expected project cost is around INR90 crore to INR100 crores, and for that also, we are going to take the debt of 75% of the total project cost.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Okay, sir. And Bareilly, anything [Speech Overlap]?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, Bareilly is very small along, so INR6 crore to INR7 crore capex is remained [Technical Issues]. Yeah. So altogether, we are going to take 70% to 75% debt.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Okay, okay. So almost INR200 crore, INR205 crore kind of capex we are planning to do in FY ’24. I think as you’ve mentioned in the presentation, the entire capex will come in this year only, FY ’24?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, yeah.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Okay, okay, okay. And Parag, given the kind of subdued demand that we are seeing currently, how do you think that can impact offtake for our capex when we complete it by end of next year — by end of FY ’24?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So I think like I said that, in terms of the sustainability of these materials going forward, because we do not see a substantial destruction in demand by the virtue that none of us are actually stopped taking a bath or none of us has actually stopped using a detergent in the washing machine, except some legislations which we are hearing which are coming in America where, to prevent drought, they are reducing the detergent cycles. So it might have an impact on the detergent because of which it might have an impact on the [indecipherable]. But apart from that, I don’t see a very substantial and a permanent destruction in demand. I think what we are seeing is kind of a recalibration because the industry is very raw material dependent for performance. And so when there were supply chain hiccups in 2021 and 2020, the industry went ahead and over-bought. And then that was followed by a recessionary trend in the major consumer markets. And so the industry will need two to three quarters of stabilization. I think we probably would be ready with our plants by then.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,Sure.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"And hopefully, with no further shocks happening, we should see a steady demand situation, where which is what we have forecasted when we did our financial and production planning for the new plants.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,Thank you.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rohit Ohri from Progressive Shares. Please go ahead.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rohit Ohri — Progressive Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Hi, sir. I understand that we still in the [indecipherable] world and there are quite a lot of negatives, which are there in the market. What I wanted to understand was this strategy that we will be going forward with the upcoming year, whether this will be a volume-based or will it be a profitable volume-based?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Can you ask the question, again? I mean, if I have understood your question correctly, you are saying that, as a company, will our focus be on volumes or will our focus be on profitable volumes?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rohit Ohri — Progressive Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Correct, sir. Yes, sir.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Okay. So yeah, I mean, as an internal philosophy, Oriental Aromatics always believes in the philosophy of profitable growth. So we will continue and strive to ensure that, by whatever means possible in terms of efficient raw material procurement, reduction in our conversion costs or process reengineering, we will try to ensure that we will — we continue to stay as profitable as possible in the context of the market and continue to sell.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rohit Ohri — Progressive Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"And we will be at par with FY ’22, ’23 kind of a revenue. Is it fair to assume that or could we see a slight decline in that?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So I think like I — like Dharmil has also mentioned that it’s like too much of looking into a crystal ball, because we are seeing a substantial attack on our sales price, which will impact the top line and the slowness will impact our volumes. And although there is reduction in the raw material costs, but the — because of the excess supply, if the selling price starts reducing even further, we might have. So I think putting all these together, we probably will be in a more clear position to answer that two to three quarters. Having said that, I think one thing is for sure that it’s going to be a tough year and we have to be resilient and we have to be watchful and we are taking all the precautionary steps that are to be taken.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rohit Ohri — Progressive Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay. My second question is related to the declining ratios and the RoEs and RoCE, and we currently are in the trough phase. So by when do you think that we start inching towards the recovery mode or maybe towards the expansion maybe like six quarters or maybe eight quarters, so that the trajectory start moving towards [indecipherable]?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So I mean, to answer your question, I probably will divide it into two parts. I’ll probably divide it into the first phase, which will be the next three to four quarters, where we probably know directionally where is our fragrance division, our specialty aroma ingredients and camphor and terpene chemicals division getting. And I think because in those three to four quarters, we’ll also have substantial new product lines as well as capacities added up. And I think once we are at that phase, then we’ll be in a position to look at the next four quarters and see there is a stable business environment then we should be in a position to kind of achieve the stable EBITDA that we always been talking about.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,If I’m allowed to ask one last question?,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rohit Ohri — Progressive Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Sir, sorry to interrupt you. Yeah, I’ll fall back in the queue.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,Yes.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rohit Ohri — Progressive Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Yesh, I’ll do that. Thanks.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Saket Saurabh, an individual investor. Please go ahead.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Hi, thanks for the opportunity. So first question, the two divisions there that I am currently struggling, so like camphor and specialty. So are we breaking even on operating level at least or we are making loss there?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So I think if you look at the specialty aroma ingredients division, we are in fact breaking even on both the sides as well, but I think there is a lot of pressure in terms of margins, more on the camphor and the terpene chemicals is for now than probably it is on the specialty aroma ingredients space, but we are kind of breaking even as of now.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay. And when you are saying breaking even, it is at EBITDA level or gross margin level?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Girish, do you want to answer that question?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, it’s at EBITDA.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Yeah, thank you. So now second, the question is to Dharmil bhai and in the last calls also we discussed that it seems to have slowed down that we are into might also have some structural aspect, given that increased competition. But what are the strategic initiatives or the big things that we are trying to do, say, at a company level to navigate to these things? Because right now it feels as if we are waiting for things to sort out, and I understand that this is a complex scenario. But [indecipherable] some of the peers, when I see, they have either gotten into long-term contracts or some are trying to talking about long-term RFPs with some major customers. So just wanted to explore, what are we, say, exploring to really see if in case this becomes a structural, do we have some bigger ideas or bigger plan to negate this? Because what I see — and I’ve been an investor in this company since camphor days or Camphor & Allied days, our free cash flow sooner or later starts — it’s very volatile. In fact, last three years, it has been negative. And so any ideas or thoughts that you can share with our investors — with investors just to get a sense of — to get some comfort of things that we are doing to — just one of these concerns, meaning when it’s, say, for the near or the long-term beyond, of course, just outlining capex plans and all those things.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So I think to probably answer your question, Saket bhai, I think we are looking at these challenges as a very big opportunity for our fragrance and flavor division. Dharmil has just said that the team there has done extremely well and we have kind of managed some very interesting strategic wins in that segment and these wins are with extremely large FMCG companies in India and abroad. So I think that is something where we are kind of in fact looking at this challenging as an opportunity and also the ability of being probably with the very few companies in the world who are backward-integrated, using all our strengths of the ingredients division to get more and more wins in the fragrance business is something which is a very, very important strategic move, which was for many years in play in building and now it’s in play. I think apart from that, about the RFQs, I think when the customers have kind of picked up only 60% to 65% of their committed allocation to really go and ask them for longer allocations, probably it’s something which is — at least in the current situation is not going to happen. When the stabilization comes, we will definitely try to use that. But till the time that the external factors are looking a little challenging on the ingredient side, however, they are very, very positive on the fragrance side. On the ingredients side, we are looking a lot of things that we can do structurally internally. So we, as management, are spending a lot of time internally in our clients. We are looking at our processes. We are looking at our costs. We are looking at productivity at each level. And that’s why we are trying to differentiate ourselves, because as we say that there is no destruction in demand. So when the demand comes back, we want to be a very leaner, meaner machine to go and fight in the market. So these are the two strategic moves. We are not very keen on having impact on the external side.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"And Parag, I would like to add is that, these long-term contracts, which you are referring to, I don’t think buyers market today there are many companies that are getting into these long-term contracts and what we are looking at is continuing to stay non-aligned, so that we can offer our products both bulk and specialty across the industry.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Correct, sir.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"So it doesn’t [Speech Overlap] take a new plant where we are making a product and selling it out to just one customer and having them do a cost-plus or taking majority of the margin. So to answer you, we will continue to stay non-aligned. We will continue to focus on our strategy of both bulk and specialty aroma chemicals. We have a large expansion going to be going online. I believe ’23, ’24 financial year, we would have completed all our expansions, except for our CST expansion, unless we are able to even finish that in this financial year. So I think there is going to be an addition of many more products in our repertoire to offer to the industry. And the long-term contracts, I don’t believe exist beyond the current RFQs, unless you’re in a complete buyback situation, which we don’t want to do.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Got it. Just one small request. It would be great if we keep the sequence of having a — Dharmil bhai give an opening remark, it gives a lot confidence to the investors.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"I’ve made a note of this comment, and I will do it next quarter and the following quarters.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks. I appreciate the support, and best of luck. I’m sure we’ll navigate these tough times.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,Right. And our idea is primarily for not giving the opening remark was to give more time to the questions.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Exactly, Q&A. No, I appreciate that. Yeah, but just a couple of opening remarks and all, they make sense — just a couple of lines you are able to articulate on some of the big ideas, so that helps.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"Sure. Well noted, and we will take care of it in the future.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Sure, sir. Thanks.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Rajat Setiya from ithoughtpms. Please go ahead.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. One clarification on Mahad capex. So you are saying INR100 crore is left. So how much is already done?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So INR100 crores is going to be the planned investment in the whole Mahad project because it’s a greenfield project, we’ll also have to do some support structure. Yeah, Girish, sorry?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, yes. I just wanted to add actually we have already infused INR32 crore into the Mahad subsidiary, and as on March, we have already invested, whether you say the pre-operative cost for this with some revenue first as well as the lend cost and lend development, total altogether is INR25 crore, INR26 crore we have already invested.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Okay. Actually, in the context is I think sometime in the previous call, you had mentioned that Mahad will probably take INR200 crores to INR250 crores. So right now, we are going to spend this much and then probably later on we’ll spend more money? Is that how it is?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Rajat, primarily it’s a phased investment where, like Dharmil said, that we are still in the process of piloting the whole CST piece. And once we are ready with that, we will probably be doing the next phase of investment in Mahad.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Understood. And so we can say that peak debt, I mean, at the end of this year, probably our debt levels will probably be INR400 crores to INR450 crores? Girish, you want to kind of [Speech Overlap].",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Girish Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. We are expecting around INR370 crore, INR380 crore.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Okay, understood. And how long will it take — once all the capex is done, how much time does it take before plant stabilization and to be sure that we are in the mass production?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So since, Rajat, we are in the generic specialty aroma ingredient space, in fact, I think we’ve already kind of had some initial checks with our customers and they are very keen. So we normally give ourselves between, say, three months to six months for validation, followed by another three months for getting the sample approvals. So we should be looking at, at least capturing 40% to 50% of the available market in the first two, two-and-a-half years.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Sure. And do you fear a scenario wherein — because current demand is anyways low and capex is going to come in a year when the demand is low or there is pricing pressure. Do you imagine a scenario that next one year when our plant is ready to fire, but we do not have enough demand?",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,"So I think these are generic materials. I think having a fragrance division as the front-end of the Group always helps, because we know which are the kind of fragrances in which it is used. We already have built solid relationships with most of the top consumers of this material globally. So demand or no demand, there will be consumption of this material, A. B, so as a strategic derisking and China Plus One, it still stays in play, albeit at a more challenging sale price. I’m sure we will be well-accepted globally in terms of the product and sale at least. And as the demand becomes more and more stable, because our simulations had been done at various cost price from very good to adverse situation.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,Sure. Thank you so much.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Parag Satoskar — Chief Executive Officer,Thanks.,OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Rajat Setiya — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today’s conference. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Dharmil Bodani from Oriental Aromatics Limited for the closing comments. Over to you, sir.",OAL,Oriental Aromatics Ltd 
Dharmil A. Bodani — Chairman and Managing Director,"Thank you so much. Thank you all for participating in this earnings conference call. I hope we’ve been able to answer your questions satisfactorily. If you have any questions or would like to know more about the Company, we would be happy to address the same.

I welcome you to discuss the performance of the fourth quarter and the year ended March ’23 for Ashiana Housing. Thank you for joining us today.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vikash Dugar — Chief Financial Officer,"The year gone by was quite active in terms of new launches. We launched five greenfield projects, new phases of existing projects, totaling to the tune of 29.46 lakh square foot. Second kid centric project was launched in Gurugram by name Ashiana Amarah. The first phase was launched in October ’22, comprising 224 units and was fully booked at launch. Phase 2 was launched in April ’24 [Phonetic], consisting of 224 units, saleable area 3.77 lakhs square foot, having a sale value of around INR283 crores. All these 224 units were converted on 17th of April. Ashiana Prakriti got launched in Jamshedpur in March ’23 with 162 units and sales value of INR163 crores. Entire phase was sold at launch. Ashiana Advik, our general third senior living project in Bhiwadi, was launched in November ’22. Ashiana Malhar in Pune was launched in August ’22. And Ashiana Ekansh in Jaipur was also launched.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vikash Dugar — Chief Financial Officer,"We achieved INR1313.43 [Phonetic] crores for financial year ’23, which was our highest-ever sales. Area booked increased by 75% from 14.76 lakhs square foot in FY ’22 to 25.86 lakhs in FY ’23. Sales price improved to INR5,080 for the current year versus INR3,883 per square foot in FY ’22, an increase of 31% year-on-year, driven by increasing prices across projects and changing mix towards higher-priced projects.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vikash Dugar — Chief Financial Officer,"In the last quarter of FY ’23, 8.59 lakh square feet of area was booked as compared to 9.03 lakh square feet in the previous quarter. In Q4, bookings were driven by new launches in Ashiana Prakriti, Jamshedpur and Ashiana Ekansh, Jaipur, and sales in older projects like Ashiana Anmol Phase 3, Gurugram, and Shubham Phase 4B, Chennai.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vikash Dugar — Chief Financial Officer,We handed over 10.51 lakh square feet in FY ’23. This was against a delivery of 8.86 lakh square foot in FY ’22. Total revenue increased to INR425.19 crores in FY ’23 versus INR233.59 crores in FY ’22 due to higher deliveries. Total comprehensive income was positive at INR28.78 crores vis-a-vis negative INR6.56 crores in FY ’22.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vikash Dugar — Chief Financial Officer,Total revenue reported for Q4 FY ’23 was INR116.94 crores vis-a-vis INR135.31 crores in the previous quarter. TCI also improved to INR10.51 crores in Q4 FY ’23 versus INR9.29 crores in Q3 FY ’23.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited

Total potential saleable area in these new land parcels will be around 21 lakh square foot.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vikash Dugar — Chief Financial Officer,"On this note, I would like to conclude my remarks. We’ll now be happy to discuss any questions or suggestions that you may have.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vikash Dugar — Chief Financial Officer,Questions and Answers:,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Vivek Joshi from VP Capital LLP [Phonetic]. Please go ahead.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,"Yeah. Congratulations, sir, for a very good set of numbers, especially on the booking front and all. So, I need — I had a couple of questions. One is that could you explain me how the expenses are booked? [Indecipherable] accounting question, like, is it related to the deliveries made? Or is it like an ongoing thing on the complete cost that has been incurred during the year? And for deliveries, in your slide, you have given that in FY ’24, you are going to be delivering around 26 lakhs square feet. So, is it reasonable to assume that given the realization rate, our booked revenue will be around — over INR1,000 crores for FY ’24?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vikash Dugar — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. Thank you for your question. So, the year in which we give the deliveries, that year only we book the revenues. And following the matching principle, the book — the costs are also booked in the same year. So, both revenue and costs are booked at the time of deliveries, or in other words, at the time of possession being given on the project. As far as revenue for FY ’24 is concerned, again, the pricing for each of these projects will have to be seen as to what exactly is the price, and then we’ll be in a position to exactly see as to what revenue will be booked.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,"I think the average [Speech Overlap] average is about 4,000 [Phonetic], so like…",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Yeah. So, for all these projects, we list our the value of area booked separately, which is provided in the sheet in this — in our operations snapshots as to what the value of area booked is of all these projects. If you take from there, you can total it and get a sense of where we’re going. It’s on Slide 12.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,"Okay. I just wanted to know if I’m approximately in the right benchmark. I’ll do the exact math, but…",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Yeah. You can do the math. I think you’ll be a little — we also haven’t done the full math. We will also do a full math. Then we’ll give the sense. But the thing is, as it wouldn’t be right because the average is also getting skewed from what is getting booked at a higher rate in the last financial year. And the deliveries that are happening in FY ’24 have been bookings which have done much earlier than that. So, the average would not be the right context year-to-date. So I would rather do the math because with sales prices can really vary a lot now [Speech Overlap].",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,Yea. got it. They would be [Speech Overlap]. Got it.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"And earlier, we used to operate in a tight range. So production ratio is better now. We have projects ranging at INR3,000 a square foot and going up to like Amarah Phase 2 I think close to INR17,700 [Phonetic] a square foot, which shows the variation in price points now has also become very large for us. I think we should just keep that in context.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,"Okay. Thank you so much. And is it okay if I ask another question? Or I’ll wait in the queue, as you please.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"You can go ahead. I think this — you can go ahead, one more question.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,"Yeah, okay. Another thing I wanted to know is that now that we have booked like 25 lakhs square foot and around INR1,300 crores value, is this a run rate we are looking to do because you would have your launches in all early planned in the coming financial year? Or this is going to vary a lot? Is this the new normal or it was an exceptional year?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"No. So, in this year, we are expecting INR1,500 crores sales value push. So, we are looking to grow this number. That said, I think quarterly variations, like last year, if you see, bulk of it came in two quarters, in the last two quarters. So I think we will continue to have quarterly variations as we go along. So we might — we’ll have a couple of great quarters and a couple of slow quarters, depending on how project and phase launches are planned in those quarters. But this year, we’re expecting INR1,500 crore.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,Thank you so much. I’ll get back in the queue for further questions. Thank you so much.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Himanshu Upadhyay O3 PMS. Please go ahead.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 PMS — Analyst,"Yeah. Hi, congrats, Varun and the whole team of Ashiana on good set of numbers and meeting the targets that you set for yourself in the beginning of the year. So, great to see the good times for the Company. And I also visited the Chennai project this year, this quarter, and it was impressive, the senior living project [Technical Issues]. My first question is, can you give an idea of this HSIIDC land deal? Has it been consummated? And what I understand from reading the document is, it seems that It will be — the final payment can happen in ’24. So, is it a long gestation deal? And what is the — I believe we can only launch project in FY ’25 or ’26? Some idea on what is happening there?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Himanshu, so we have paid 25% of the sums of money. We are waiting to now execute what they call a formal agreement to sell. Post execution of formal agreement to sell, we have up till 12 months to make the remaining payment. And thereafter, we can go for plan approvals and stuff like that. Now, we are also — there is a process for us to carry out our design. And unfortunately at Ashiana or fortunately at Ashiana, we take a lot of time to design because design is our winning edge. So time consumption in design is a little high, but it also leads to a good product. So we’re going to use a substantial part of this time to get a design ready. And some approvals like environmental approvals, we can move [Technical Issues] paying the full amount. So we’ll be using that time. Anyways, we would have expected a 12-month to-18 month timeframe of launch since we did the deal. So we are not expecting the launch of the project in FY ’24, no matter what the payment terms are. We would like to launch this project in FY ’25.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 PMS — Analyst,"Okay. Thanks for the clarity. And one more thing, you gave a target of INR1,500 crores of sales for FY ’24. We did 2.6 million square feet of sales in FY ’23. And we have — so, do you think that we’ll be focusing more on the sales area-wise? Or do you think the realization itself will take us to our desired target of higher 20% sales growth for [Speech Overlap]?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"A combination of both, Himanshu. So, some places, we will push for higher sale prices like at Gurugram in Ashiana Amarah Phase 2. We launched the Phase 2 which, we disclosed, was also at a much higher sale value. I think 224 units at this time and INR7,700 average per square foot pricing as compared to INR6,100 in Phase 1 in Amarah. So in Amarah, we are looking at that. But in some other projects, in Jaipur, we expect volume push as well. So there would be different flavors in different locations. So it’ll be a combination of the two when we look at it.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 PMS — Analyst,"And are we back to the peak margins what we used to do in terms of gross margins in the projects what we are selling? So we stated that 30% gross margin had come down to 24%, 25%. Are we — in the incremental sales, what we are doing, can we expect the gross margins to be back to the historical high what we were doing?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Yes. So 30% is probably average, what we would like to be. And we would expect 30% gross margins on a blended basis across the projects. That said, the older projects like Ashiana Anmol, even at current price points will not make those kinds of margins. But all the new — any projects that we have signed off on after 2015, I think we’ll be able to maintain 30% gross margin or more. We launched five projects last year: Ashiana Advik, Ashiana Amarah, Ashiana Prakriti, Ashiana Ekansh and Ashiana Malhar. Malhar is an older deal that we had done in 2017, not sold, but 2017 as well there, and deal in Pune, where our margins are a little compromised. They are not in the 30% or close by. But rest of the projects are — in JV projects, we are also okay with 27%, 28%, 29%, and we’ll get those in the JV projects. In the owned projects, we will be north of 30%. And across these five projects, I think blended average will be more than 30% across all the five projects.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 PMS — Analyst,"Okay. I’ll join back in queue for further queries. Yeah, thanks for the replies.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Thank you, Himanshu.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Praveen Agarwal as an individual investor. Please go ahead.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Praveen Agarwal —  — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. A quick question. So, I just wanted to understand when we underwrite the projects, so what is the internal IRR which we look at? And what is the time — so, essentially, if you take a parcel of land and we do three, four phases, how much time does it take from the first land was purchased — and I see that typically, we complete eight to 10 quarters, one phase. But typically, how much time does it take a parcel of land to completely consumed? And what is the internal IRR which we target on a land when we purchase that?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"So, Praveen, a couple of things. First, from a time cycle, I think the project takes about 12 months to 18 months to get off the ground before — after purchase, it takes time for approvals. It takes time to get the site ready from a salability perspective, get our sales office and all that going and our design ready. So, about 12 months to 18 months to launch the project, and sometimes even extending up to two years. And from thereon, a project takes about five to seven years to be fully consumed, depending on the size of the project and number of phases that we have. And now, coming back from an IRR perspective, we have — we don’t really do IRR calculations. We don’t run very complex Excel sheets to do IRR calculation. We have very thumb rule mathematics. And in our thumb rule mathematics, at the Company-level, we look for — we are now looking for a 15% return on equity at the portfolio Company-level, including uninvested capital at any point in time. So — and it becomes very difficult to calculate project-level IRRs by allocating overhead and stuff like that. So we have a threshold that we want to make a 30%. GP margin on the project, and we run our sort of absolute profits that what we get in the project and look at a multiple on our investments in that. So, that’s the kind of thumb rule, and we expect to make 15% ROEs — 15% plus ROEs in the Company.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Praveen Agarwal —  — Analyst,"That’s good to hear. So — and on the 15% ROE basis, we know that last few years were tough. But at one point, going forward, do we think that we’ll start doing those 15% ROE? Given what we have booked in 2023, these are — will that all yield to — as and when these gets executed and get booked into our financials, will they all yields 15% ROE on our equity capital?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Yes, that’s the expectation that we should be able to do that. So, we also track what we call economic ROE in the Company as to see deliveries can be very delayed, how the company is looking and how that is translating in our — we have a metric for economic ROE calculations, and our expectations are that the economic ROE should start crossing 15% threshold from FY ’23-’24. ’22-’23, we have hit double-digits in our economic ROE calculation. In ’23-’24, that should start doing better. So the margins — and an earlier question, I think, was around margins by Himanshu, and as margins have improved and the sale volume has improved, the value has improved, I think we are looking at good times ahead right now.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Praveen Agarwal —  — Analyst,"That’s great to hear. So my last question is on the new land parcel, which will — or the cities which you are looking to acquire or do projects. And any color on the land which you are looking to buy?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"So, one, we did the HSIIDC transaction in Gurgaon in March. Gurgaon is something we were looking for more work, and I think that seems to be fitting in. And other than that, there are two active negotiations going on, and then we’ll start looking for more in — so two active negotiations, one in Jaipur and one elsewhere. But that’s about it at this point in time. But that’s enough to keep refilling the pipe, right? Last year, we ended up effectively doing 20 lakh square foot of deals between HSIIDC and two in Jaipur. And right now, we are also in active discussions for two projects, which together will be another 20 lakh square foot. So it seems to be okay as a replacement stock. I think on aggression to get more and more stock, we are just waiting for prices to be a little bit more conducive. [Speech Overlap]",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Praveen Agarwal —  — Analyst,"One last question before I hand it over. So, is now Gurgaon an integral part of our strategy? We are — historically, we’re very strong in Jaipur, Bhiwadi kind of areas. So, is it — would it be fair to assume that going forward, for the next foreseeable future, Gurgaon will play more and more important role in the overall scheme of things?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Absolutely, Gurgaon is going to play a very key role for the Company going forward. It drove I think 40% of the value of area booked for the Company last year. Volumes were not as much. Pricing was higher. It is going to be an integral part of our strategy. I think that and senior living are going to be the integral aspects of Gurgaon [Phonetic].",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Praveen Agarwal —  — Analyst,That’s good to hear. Nothing else from my side. Thank you.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Thank you, Praveen.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ankit Gupta from Bamboo Capital. Please go ahead.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Yeah. Thanks for the opportunity, and congratulations for the great performance during FY ’23. In our Amarah project, you talked about the new bookings being done at a rate of INR7,700 per square foot compared to — in Phase 2 compared to Phase 1 pricing of around INR6,100 per square foot. So if you can talk about what is driving this increase in realization? Is it the demand in that specific market? Now, so if you can talk about the pricing across the rest of our key geographies like Jaipur and Bhiwadi and others, Jamshedpur?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Okay. So, yeah, most of our projects are now getting priced in the INR4,000 to INR6,000 bracket. There are some less than that as well, like Jodhpur would be less than INR4,000. Bhiwadi general housing would be less than INR4,000. But now, Bhiwadi senior living is INR4,500 odd, and Pune would be INR5,000 plus, and INR6,000 plus also in senior living expectations there. So, different markets have different price points. I think even in Jamshedpur, we crossed the INR5,000 benchmark in the last launch that we had. So,I think we are operating in the INR4,000 to INR6,000 bracket across most of the projects. In Gurgaon, I think one — in Phase 1, our brand was not as well established as I would say. So, as when we sold, got some things going, our brand got better established, we got more traction, and then Phase 2 prices improved for us. But the market also has gone up really high in Gurgaon. And I think more than the demand, it’s a lack of supply in Gurgaon. Very few group housing projects have been launched in Gurgaon. Most launches in Gurgaon have been around floors. And that lack of supply is helping prices go up.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"And what about — how are you seeing traction in pricing across other geographies, key geographies like Jaipur and Bhiwadi?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"As I said, prices are ranging between INR4,000 to INR6,000 there. Prices across the board have gone up. And prices and margins — we are comfortable with prices and margins at a portfolio level. There will be a few projects which are still concerning, but that I think probably will always be the case.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Sure. And my second question was on our bidding [Phonetic] pipeline, and you say that the land prices have become a bit — have gone up quite a bit. So, is it that the demand across the sector has gone up significantly that developers are bidding the prices up? So, what is the reason for such a [Speech Overlap]?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"I have alluded to this before. The price increase in land has been driven mostly by plotted developments. And as plotted developments like in Gurgaon, they have — prices have come — all plotted developments are not getting licenses anymore. We see demand for land has reduced. We were able to get a good deal, I believe, in HSIIDC land price because it was the only approved housing plot on auction. And therefore, there were not that many bidders for group housing for that plot, and we were able to get value. I don’t see a lot of demand for group housing land yet still in the system, but land has alternative uses like plotting, and that had bidden [Phonetic] up. I think they started correcting now. I think plot prices are either plateaued or started falling a little bit in a few markets. I think they were fundamentally off the charts.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Got it. And with increasing focus on Gurgaon, which is a relatively…",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Ankit, can I request you for a last question, please? Because we have a little bit of a long queue after this show. Just last question.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"[Speech Overlap] so how do you see our realizations over the next two, three years from — we ended this year with around INR5,000 [Phonetic], INR5,080 per square feet with our increasing focus on Gurgaon as well as other cities. So, how do you think our realization can be over the next two, three years?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"So, we will have I think a wider price bracket, and a lot of the portfolio will define that. I think Jaipur will continue to operate in INR4,000 to INR5,500, INR4,000 to INR6,000 kind of a price range. Gurgaon will now I think be closer to INR7,500 to INR8,500 square foot price range, depending on the new projects we take up, where we take up. Senior living, I think we are crossing the INR5,000 threshold across the board, getting closer to INR6,000. So there are different things. Bhiwadi and Jodhpur general housing continue to feel pressure. So, a lot of our price points will also now depend on the mix of projects that are sold in a particular period.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,Thank you.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Anuj Sharma from M3 Investment. Please go ahead.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Anuj Sharma — Analyst — Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you, and congratulations. Varun, I don’t know if this was discussed but at the stake of repeating it, if we exclude the project mix, then what was the pricing improvement on a like-for-like basis in FY ’23?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"It’s very hard to say on a like-to-like basis, I think, because as a project has got completed and you’ve launched a new project, in that, it becomes very difficult. So, we don’t do like-to-like tracking because they’re different across different projects, and they have different weights in different years. So, taking out weighted average becomes a problem. If a project is selling a few unit this year because it has less stock, its weight might be less in this particular year, higher in the — so it becomes very problematic to look at that. So, we look at a portfolio basis. But I think, as I said, INR4,000 — our new normal — our normal earlier was I think INR3,300, INR3,400 a square foot to operate on like a base case scenario. I think that base case scenario has shifted to INR4,000 a square foot. So maybe that’s the way to look at it, like maybe a 15%, 20% shift over a 24-month period is probably an ideal way to say where our base has shifted.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Anuj Sharma — Analyst — Analyst,"Okay. Got that. And just an extension. So going forward, even if I take a 20% from INR3,300 to INR4,000, 10% to 15% is something which we could look on like-on-like basis across portfolio? And which are the markets wherein you think you can push through pricing literally easily in your whole portfolio? Thank you.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"So, I would not comment on how much price increase we will look at year-on-year. If you had asked me this at the beginning of the year last year, I wouldn’t have said the kind of increase we saw over the last two years. Unfortunately, I’m not able to give a call on that. That said, confidence on pricing in Gurgaon, Jaipur and senior living is — and Jamshedpur are generally the highest as of now. And I see that to continue.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Anuj Sharma — Analyst — Analyst,Thank you.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of V.P. Rajesh from Banyan Capital. Please go ahead.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
V.P. Rajesh — Banyan Capital — Analyst,"Hi, congratulations, Varun. Just two quick questions. One, on the realization that we were just talking about, our increase in realization has been much lower than the general inflation over the last 10 years. So, are you consciously trying to push realization up by getting into the [Technical Issues] or not really, and you’re just going to see how it should [Technical Issues]?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"I think — V.P., I think 10 years of inflation has been captured or seven years of inflation has been captured right now. If I really inflate prices from let’s say a 2010 perspective in markets we are in, we would be hardly at inflation [Indecipherable]. So I think there is — on that basis, there is room, but you never know if 2010 is a good baseline number to take. But there was a lot of catching up to do in real estate prices in general because there were no increases for a few years. And there is still some catching up to do in the market.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
V.P. Rajesh — Banyan Capital — Analyst,"Got you. And my second question is on the ROE side. The slides assume [Phonetic] that you are moving up the guidance to 15%. But just curious to know what has been the ROE for this year, if you have already the numbers on the — not on the reported P&L but the economic value that you track?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vikash Dugar — Chief Financial Officer,"Hi, Rajesh, Vikash here. So we have been improving our ROE year-on-year. And so, this year, in FY ’23, we have crossed the double-digit number, although directionally, the target is to achieve a 15% kind of a number about which Varunji spoke a while back. But this year, we have certainly improved and we are in double-digits now.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
V.P. Rajesh — Banyan Capital — Analyst,"Okay, great. Congratulations. And that’s all I had.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,Thank you. Next question is from the line of Shivam [Phonetic] as an additional investor. Please go ahead.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Shivam —  — Analyst,"So, I just heard your guidance. Will it be INR1,500 crores for FY ’24?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vikash Dugar — Chief Financial Officer,Yes.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Shivam —  — Analyst,Okay. And what kind of — can you give us an estimate of what kind of PAT percentage can we expect?,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"This INR1,500 crores is not a revenue number. This is the pre-sales number, value of area booked.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Shivam —  — Analyst,"Yeah, that I understand. How much of the PAT percentage usually we target like if you’re doing pre-sales of INR1,500 crore?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"So, we are targeting a 30% GP. We target about, let’s say, 4% to 4.5% of sales and marketing expenses. And the overheads are our fixed overhead number. It’s not a percentage number. There is operating leverage. Those are reported. So let’s say, if I exclude depreciation and finance from that — or in that, last year, that cost overall was about INR65 crores, INR70 crores according to [Technical Issues].",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,"Sir, we’re unable to hear you clearly. Again, the voice was cracking.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,Can you here me now?,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,"No, just give me a minute. I will quickly reconnect you. Ladies and gentlemen, we request you all to please remain connected while we reconnect the management. Thank you.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for patiently waiting. We have the management line reconnected. Sir, over to you.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Yeah, hi. So we had a question on margin.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Shivam —  — Analyst,"Yeah, any estimate PAT margin percentage, any estimate. I don’t want the exact…",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"I’ll let you walk through this. So we expect a 30% GP margin. Currently, sales and marketing expenses on new projects are running at about 4% to 4.5%, which were earlier much larger number and they’ve started trending downwards on sales and marketing. And administrative and corporate overheads, we’re running about 7% odd. And you take off your tax from that, then you will get to a PAT margin. So hopefully, we can operate at a PAT margin of about 13% to 15%, depending on what our blended GP margin or sales and marketing costs are there in a particular year.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Shivam —  — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, any guidance that you can give that how much is the current land bank potential in terms of sales? Any target, if possible? If any internal target you have?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Yeah, sure. So in terms of — we have already booked about — nearly about INR2,100 crores of stock, which is booked but not recognized from revenue perspective. And we have another 1 crore and some square foot to sell. I would say that blended — you can take that value at about INR5,500 rupees to about INR5,500 crores of sales value from that.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Shivam —  — Analyst,"Okay, thank you.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,Thank you.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rahul Jain as an individual investor. Please go ahead.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Rahul Jain —  — Analyst,Yeah. I heard you mention about this economic ROE. So can you explain a little bit how you’re calculating this economic ROE?,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"So, we are just basically taking — we do some math on equivalent area constructed. We do a math on the area booked. We apply what we have as the per square foot margins to those numbers and then take out where we are looking to go. So it just gives a sense of the direction of where reported numbers will get because we get this — basically, our job is to sell and to produce, and we take that number of units we’re selling, number of units we’re producing, apply our blended average per squared foot margin that we calculate through our costs and our sales and then calculate that margin number. We will give a little bit more detailed explanation in the Annual Report this time, and you can have a sense of it.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Rahul Jain —  — Analyst,Okay. And any color on buyback or something — I think you had mentioned in the previous quarter about discussing with the Board about the buyback.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"So we haven’t yet firmed up anything or anything like that. As some analysts had suggested on the call, we have been contemplating it, been understanding it and trying to wrap our heads around it. We don’t have any specific color on this.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Rahul Jain —  — Analyst,Got you. Nothing more from me.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Thank you, Rahul.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rishi Singhal [Phonetic] as an individual investor. Please go ahead.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Rishi Singhal —  — Analyst,[Foreign Speech],ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"[Foreign Speech] particularly, they have different implication. And the hotel makes — on our invested capital, makes about 15% returns right now. So we are okay with that kind of returns, a little bit here or there on the detail, but the hotel is not something that is concerning us too much. It does not have significant amount of capital deployed. But there are other items that they’re slowly and slowly trying to dispose of and move those out. And school is an asset that we do intend to transact on.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Rishi Singhal —  — Analyst,Okay. [Foreign Speech],ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"[Foreign Speech] The pre-launch process has got activated there. And for Bhiwadi, I would take [Foreign Speech] that is is in the middle of the industrial area of Bhiwadi, and where our projects are far away from it. So once you come into the city, into the project, you will not see that. [Foreign Speech]. And Bhiwadi is less polluted than where I live in Delhi — or not Bhiwadi, our Ashiana Nirmay, Ashiana Advik and Ashiana Town are less polluted than where I live in peak winters. [Foreign Speech] so we can open new things in there [Foreign Speech].",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited

Varun Gupta — Director,[Foreign Speech],ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited

Rishi Singhal —  — Analyst,Thank you very much. It was very informative. Thank you very much.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from Vivek Joshi from VP Capital LLP. Please go ahead.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. I’m just coming back to the queue again. So EBITDA margins have been lower, if I understand from what you’ve told in the call, because of the [Technical Issues]",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Vivek, your voice is breaking. We couldn’t understand you.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,Yeah. Is that clear now? Is it better?,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,Yeah.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,"So what I wanted to understand was, the EBITDA in the last [Technical Issues] have been like low. Is it because of cost overruns of projects, which were [Technical Issues]?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"No. So EBITDA means, over the last few years or going forward, you mean?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,"Over the last few years. Just to understand like if cost were always on project-to-project basis, why was EBITDA margin so low.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Because of depressed volumes. So what has happened, our overhead was structured for a much larger set of operations, and then our operations declined. So a decline in operations because volume of square footage declined. So, our margins started getting worse. So, that movement is where we really-really got hurt was basically that. And second, yes, we got stuck in the higher operations costs as compared to sales price because sales price compressed or remained stagnant over five, six years in terms of per square foot, but your construction costs increased. You were locked into high land costs thinking sale prices will actually increase, where they actually decreased. So, our assumption on some of the projects we took at the peak of the cycle went out of that, and we had lower volume, so our fixed cost started hurting. So, we got crushed from two, three places here.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Vivek Joshi — VP Capital LLP — Analyst,"Yeah. And thanks, and all the best. It’s wonderful to see you optimistic — so optimistic. I’ve been looking to your calls for many years. This is the most optimistic I’ve heard you. All the best.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited

Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 PMS — Analyst,"Yeah. Hi, Varun. This is just — what did you state about business development and how are you looking at the geographies where you want to focus in terms of business development for next two years, or FY ’24-’25?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"So we want to concentrate on existing geographies only, Himanshu, where we are, outside of senior living. For senior living, we are looking at a couple of more cities. And right now, I think we are doing a replacement stock addition mostly. So, we added about 20 lakh square foot last year, two deals in Jaipur, one in Gurgaon. We are in active discussions for another 20 lakh square foot total across two transactions that we spoke about. Till markets become a little bit more conducive for more transactions, we will look to add replacements stock in a little bit more. And I think, as I said, now I see land prices becoming a lot more viable and sale prices have gone up, land prices have been flat, the plotting market is not doing as well as it was doing earlier, so the demand for land from the plotted developers has reduced, which is lending to prices being — on the land beeing plateauing and capping off. So I would see hopefully, we’ll start seeing more aggression maybe in six to eight months’ time, or maybe 12 months’ time for any deals. But till then, it’s mostly replacement stock kind of deals we’re focusing on.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 PMS — Analyst,"And you stated about this plotted development. Is it just an NCR phenomenon? Or you are seeing this across the board, even Chennai and basically Pune market?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Plotted development has been a Gurgaon — NCR, Gurgaon and Jaipur phenomena, and that’s where we were looking to do more BD because we needed more stock there and we see volumes going up. Chennai and Pune, we have I think good stock right now to sell and senior living projects to actually launch. Chennai get close to about 18.5 lakh square foot across three projects in senior living that have to be launched. Pune, we had just in the pre-launch zone of a project in Talegaon for senior living. So there we had already stock. We were not aggressively looking. So I am — hard to comment what’s going on there in land prices. My plotted development, please keep to Gurgaon and Jaipur as the context.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 PMS — Analyst,"Okay. And can you give an idea of, let’s say, from FY ’20 — let’s take FY ’20 base figure, how much would land prices have increased and the realizations would have increased in the NCR, Jaipur and the Chennai market where major sales are happening for us?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"So, NCR and Jaipur, land prices would have gone up close to double since FY ’20 and sale prices would have gone up 20% on the base, but 40%, 50% also in some places.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 PMS — Analyst,"Okay. Coming to the next thing, we see a lot of optimism across the real estate. And we are seeing — all listed companies are thinking about business development or doing business development. Everybody’s business development in FY ’23 is higher than what they did in FY ’20. All real estate companies, I’m talking about. As an outsider, how do I understand that people are not going overboard in this sector now? Because of what we had long issues in the cycle in last 10 years, how do I understand that? Are we…",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"[Technical Issues] therefore is to look at joint venture transaction. And in joint venture transactions like revenue share, do you see increasing revenue share that people are providing? Are they able to control it? So, that will give a good sense. Start asking for how the math — look on those — do you think people are pushing the sale prices to make the math work? Those are couple of things that you’d like to look at. So we have made a basic idea that we will not cross this kind of a revenue share threshold whatsoever. And if you do it as a revenue share threshold, at least you are protected from the margin front a little bit. So we’re doing those kind of thought processes ourselves. But you’ll have to run the numbers on that math. Running the land price numbers are not a very hard thing to do. It’s a very simple thing to do to see whether they make sense [Technical Issues].",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — O3 PMS — Analyst,Thank you.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,Thank you.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,"The next question is from Sri [Phonetic] as an individual investor. Please go ahead. Sir, my question is, a couple of calls back, you had spoken about you would have to increase the base of your company as you grow. Could you give me a sense of what base are you targeting as — I mean, across cycles, something that you would want to increase to?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,Yeah. We are targeting a 15% ROE. So in case you don’t raise capital [Speech Overlap] somewhere around that. Maybe a couple of percentage points lower for dividend or something like that. That low-teens kind of growth rate is what we are looking at.,ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,"I wasn’t referring to ROE. I was referring to the scale of the Company. So, you spoke about the base scale of the Company. Are you targeting a certain scale of the Company for — I mean, are you planning increase that scale?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"Ideally, we would like to change the base scale of the Company to twice of what it is in a five-year kind of a threshold.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Operator,"Okay. And how would we take the base to be as in — what would be now — if you could give some color on that, what base would you consider as of now?",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited 
Varun Gupta — Director,"So, right now, I think the base scale of the Company would be around — in a downcycle, we would have upped the base of the Company to about 14 lakh, 15 lakh square foot now. [Indecipherable] of sale as a base. This scenario in poor cycles is probably where I would estimate that to be. But let’s be careful that’s an estimate. It’s not somewhere where I can say this is what the reality looks like. It’s an estimate that I have on basis of my understanding of where we are operating. So, I believe that’s what we would like to shift — the Company to shift the base scale of the Company to maybe about 25 lakh, 30 lakh square foot, and in the cycle times, we’ll be doing better than that as well. And I expect the cycle — I expect the real estate cycle to last a few good years right now. It’s still at the beginning of the cycle.",ASHIANA,Ashiana Housing Limited

The last mile delivery services have become the need of an hour across several sectors, especially with the globalization of e-commerce across rural India. Post the pandemic, online shopping has become more popular and having access all in the villages among the markets. As you all know, e-commerce is penetrating the rural area of India very well, thanks to the advanced smartphones and the high-speed internet provided by the government of India. This trend gives us confidence of our Abhilaya venture, wherein we are offering last-mile services.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Another point that I would like to highlight that we are cognizant of our — impact on our environment impact and trying to minimize the carbon footprint. In the line of this, we launched a few EV scooters in the first half of this financial year for smooth and timely delivery for Amazon order, mainly in Maharashtra and in Gujarat region.

Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Now turning to our financial performance. Fourth quarter of financial year ’23, we reported a total INR113.16 crores in revenue during Q4 of financial year ’23. This decrease in the revenue mainly due to the decrease in the freight rate of more than 80% in the shipping market.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Our EBITDA for the quarter stood INR1.19 crore, decreased EBITDA on account of lower revenue and higher employee expenses on account of one-time bonus.

Net profit margins stood at 0.79%. EPS as for this period is INR3.07.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,This is all from our side. I think we can now take questions from our shareholders.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,Questions and Answers:,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Sudhir Bheda from Right Time Consultancy. Please go ahead.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Sudhir Bheda — Right Time Consultancy — Analyst,Hello sir. Good morning.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Good afternoon, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Sudhir Bheda — Right Time Consultancy — Analyst,"And hearty congratulations for the good set of numbers under the circumstances where freight rate has come down by 80% to 85%. And also I will appreciate you for the startup company, OneWorld Logistics, which has now gone to INR68 crore turnover in just four years. So again, from the shareholder side, I appreciate that.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Thank you very much, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Sudhir Bheda — Right Time Consultancy — Analyst,"I have two questions. One, now that startup company, last mile delivery company OneWorld Logistics has grown to INR68 crore, but the losses have gone to INR7 crores. So what are your plans in the next two to three years for OneWorld Logistics? And what is the medium term and long-term outlook for this company? That is number one. And number two, your main business, standalone, what percentage of growth do you expect in FY’24?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Yes, sir. Sir, I’ll answer your question about — first question. Last mile delivery, last year, we did various — did enter into various models of direct transportation services with Amazon in the Diwali time, and which given us a bad — I mean, bad experience due to operational issues. As they committed us with the certain volumes, can be — they made us available during the Diwali season. And that time we hired a truck on the fixed basis, assuring them the load as well as the number of plying between these route. But unfortunately, the volumes got dropped due to the orders were less on the — with Amazon. So, but we had to pay this money to our vendors we committed to them. So, this was one of the setbacks. Also, the last year, we added some stations of — basically, in the Jammu Kashmir area, where we had some issues over deliveries, over manpower and all. So, in the month of March, we had taken a cautious decision, and we started closing the non-productive, non-operating, non-operative profit stations across India. So we cut down almost 45 plus stations of Flipkart and almost three to four stations of Amazon. But at the same time, Amazon has given us certain other stations in other areas like Rajasthan and certainly the MP. So that has been compensated.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"So the necessary steps have been taken that loss making stations, we already closed down. We will not enter into any, you know, any seasonal businesses like transportation or warehousing or, you know, particular seasons or taking the load. So this has impact, started giving us the impact. And I’m really happy to say that in the month of April, we could cut down the loss to the minimal. Earlier it was INR50 lakhs per month, which has dropped down to the now INR89 lakhs a month. So that is a big step we have already taken.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Furthermore, we have started two new models here in Mumbai and in Maharashtra. We have joined with the — made a JV with one company called Go4Fresh, and they deal with imported foods and vegetables. They buy from the importers and we are exporting distribution for them to the western side of the Mumbai City. And soon the 15 pin posts are already up right from Dahisar, Borivali to Goregaon and coming up to the Khar area. Soon it will be added central side and then we’ll move on to the Vashi. So we have target by end of this financial year, whish should go to INR25 crores of turnover in topline. And this is giving us almost 2.5% margin. So this is not a loss-making model what we are entered into.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Further, we made an agreement with two e-commerce small players here in Mumbai. And they have, every day, close to 50,000 shipments of various brands. They wanted to distribute to the — from Bhiwandi area to Mumbai as well as the New Bombay area. So we started that activity in the late second week of April onwards. So that activity is now picking up very well. We are a little bit, I think, close to 2,000 shipments a day on June month. So these also activities is giving us some markings on the top line.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"So, all combination together I am sure for the financial year 2024 we should turn the OneWorld Logistics into — from red at the PBT level to Black in the PBT level definitely.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"The second question is Total Transport Systems growth, there is a huge drop in the freight levels of the variant in line, which is a slack in the demand and the addition in the ships, number of ships and as well as container inventory has been improved a lot. Still, we could manage to get — manage to retain our position because we are more focused in the CIS and Russia sector, this is more of niche market and it’s not more competitive or not where many players are operating on this line. So we are more focused on this area, which is giving us, you know, decent profitability as well as volumes also increasing in this. So, with these all combinations and new project division we started, we also handle ships projects from some from Bombay port, some from Mundra, some from overseas like Manila or Singapore to that is Mombasa, that is Africa. So we are moving some big machinery, we have moved some lifeboats of, you know, to be put on the ships and all.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"So, activity is really picking up fast and people are realizing that we are also are in this market. So I am sure slowly we should get larger parcels and this activity should give us the good return by end of this financial year.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"So, clubbing all together, the projections what we had in this financial year, I’m sure we — with all strength and focus and hard work, we should be able to achieve that.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Sudhir Bheda — Right Time Consultancy — Analyst,"Great, great. Congratulations once again and thanks for the opportunity to ask the question and all the best.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Operator,Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Hiral Nandu from Kalpavruksh Capital [Phonetic]. Please go ahead.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Hiral Nandu — Kalpavruksh Capital — Analyst,Congratulations for the good numbers. I just wanted to understand as we see the freight rates were dropped during the last year for by around 80 plus percentage. So has there been any upward revision in the freight rate in recent times and what is that percentage on how much sustainable that rate would be or what will be the future outlook on the freight rate? What do you see in that?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,Can I answer this Shrikant?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Yes, yes.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"Okay, this is Pradhan. Okay, in the last three months there has been no upward revision in the freight level. There is neither a downward revision because what we think is this is the market has bottomed out. [Technical Issues]",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,His connection got lost.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Operator,"I am sorry sir. May I request the members of the management, the other members to please continue as sir’s line has been disconnected. Please continue while I try to reconnect, Makarand sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Yes, so the main thing that happened in the last quarter of the last year, I mean third quarter from the last year, new ships which has come in the market with the higher capacity. At the same time, the refugees which have been seen in this whole of Europe due to Ukraine-Russia war and the demands and all this has been slow down, which has impacted on the global cargo movements definitely. So as a shipping alliance, total review of cargo movement worldwide, what we see that this trend will continue for next two quarters. And we anticipate that things should start improvisation from the January 2024 almost. So with this freight level for the — from India in and out to Europe as well as U.S., South Central America, maybe some Africa sectors will be lower down. So there is a huge capacity or rather huge, there is a huge chance of maintaining the freight levels for CIS destinations because these are very odd destinations. There is no regular ship services. And many destinations are inland container depots. So there has to be multimodal transportation that needs to be done to reach the cargo there. Plus, Russia is picking up very, very well, especially pharma cargo and engineering goods. So these are the two advantages what we have today. But overall shipping freight levels, we anticipate that we will lie low till third quarter of this financial year.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Hiral Nandu — Kalpavruksh Capital — Analyst,"Okay. And what would be the rate per ton, approximate, range I’m trying to understand.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"It is not per ton, it is actually per sector wise it goes on. Like today European sector which we in the peak season of Corona which we have loaded $8,000 per container. Today it is available at the rate of $800 a container. So it is a huge reduction in the rate because ship capacity has gone up with the rise. Secondly, China, which were making the contribution of this zero policy of corona, now they had opened up since last quarter. But still, they need to get that kind of order from the various countries, mainly Europe and South Central America, so they can gear up their production. So with all the — things should start improvisation from 2024 onwards, early 2024 onwards.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Hiral Nandu — Kalpavruksh Capital — Analyst,"Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you, sir, for your time, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nikhil Arora [Phonetic], an individual investor.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Nikhil Arora —  — Analyst,Hello?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Yes, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Nikhil Arora —  — Analyst,"Yes. Thank you for the opportunity, sir. First question is, our exports have been predominantly higher than the imports. So if you can throw some light, like are exports expected to increase or — sorry, imports are expected to increase or exports will still increase?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"I did not understand your question. Can you repeat it, please?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Operator,"I’m sorry to interrupt, Mr. Arora, if I could request you to use your handset please to ask your question.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited

Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,Exports will still lead the race as per the statistics.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Nikhil Arora —  — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, what is the current number of shipments we are doing per month?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"On an average, we do about 36,000 containers per annum. So about 3,000 containers. And our mix is about 40:60 or 45:55.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Nikhil Arora —  — Analyst,"Okay, sir. And who are the top contributing clients and if any new client addition which has happened recently?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"We are into retailing. Our major customers, 95% of the business comes from freight forwarders. And if you want to talk about names, it is like Express Transport, Velji Dosabhai and Company, even Tata Motors have cargoes carrying for Reliance, Ranberry and there are many, Raymonds is one of them. So it all depends. We don’t depend on one single customer for our volumes. To do this volume, we have nearly 1,100 customers active.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Nikhil Arora —  — Analyst,"Also, if there are any new projects which are there in the pipeline for this financial year?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"Yes, we are working on various project transport and we will see the results very soon. In the last two months we have done three of them and we expect that we will have some more projects coming in our way in the coming quarters.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Nikhil Arora —  — Analyst,"Okay, sir. In the last call, you said that we were about to get some 70 odd stations from Flipkart. So can you throw some light like what is the current status of that?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"So we already got 70 — I mean, we’ve given confirmation of 70, out of which 58 stations are already up and balance stations we said no, we won’t doing it up because this is very close to Srinagar area. So we had withdrawn from that. So 58 stations is already up and now our monthly volume all put together Amazon and Flipkart, we are handling close to 22.7 million shipments a month, that is 22.7 lakh shipments per month. And from June onwards, we should be touching close to 30 lakh shipments a month.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Nikhil Arora —  — Analyst,"Okay, sir. And my last question, the long term and the short term borrowings have reduced as compared to FY ’22. So, have we repaid any debt?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"Yes, actually we had one WPTL, working capital term loan from Axis Bank that we repaid as our cash flow due to corona and all this high freight rates has improved a lot. So we repaid that loan. So that’s how the things have been changed.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Nikhil Arora —  — Analyst,"Okay sir, thank you for the information and all the best for the next call, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Thank you, sir. Thank you for the question.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited

Daniel —  — Analyst,"Okay, sir. And then what is our current capital cycle for financial year 2023?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,You mean DSO? Hello?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,"Our current capital, sir. Yes, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,DSO is now dropped to the 42 days.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,"Okay. In FY ’22, tax rate which is 32%, it has increased to 47% in FY ’23. So, is there any reason in the increase of tax rate?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,I will check on that. Okay. Hello. Mr. Nitin is there?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
"Nitin Phadke — Vice President, Finance","Sir, can I give the answer?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Yes, Nitin.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
"Nitin Phadke — Vice President, Finance","This is Nitin Phadke. The tax rate has not changed. But because of the loss which is there from OneWorld, which has gone up — the profit figure has been distorted, and that’s why you feel that the rate had changed. If you see standalone the rate is 26%, which is as per the income tax normal rate.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,"Okay. Also talking about interest cost, it increased by around 50-55% on year on year basis. So what has led to this increase in the interest cost?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
"Nitin Phadke — Vice President, Finance","Sir, interest percentage which was there in the last financial year, it was 8.55%. But in the current — in the financial year ’22-’23 as you are aware that RBI has increased the rate every time. It is more than 11%. That has basically affected the interest cost.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,Okay. And there was a shortfall in EBITDA for Q4 FY ’23 on a Y-o-Y basis. So is there a reason behind this in the EBITDA?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
"Nitin Phadke — Vice President, Finance","The reason behind this is basically the drop down in the freight rates, the turnover has also been reduced and the margin has also reduced. That’s the reason the profit has reduced, obviously it will affect the EBITDA.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,Can I — I just want to give one clarification here.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,"Yes, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"The freight rates have gone down by 80%, okay? Now let’s assume a freight for Europe, what Mr. Shrikant mentioned earlier. It was $8,000. Today it is $800. So obviously on $8,000 we could have a margin of maybe $500, maybe $400. Whereas when the freight levels are so down, we have — our margins get reduced to a certain percentage, maybe 5%, maybe 7%. So that is the effect. But what we have done is it is not seen so much on the figures is because our volumes have gone up quite a lot. And secondly, we have gone very aggressive into the CIS region and Africa. So still on certain sectors we have been able to maintain our profitability to a great extent. And that’s the reason it is not seen that there is a, though there is a drop of 80% of the freight levels, our profits or our overall turnover hasn’t dropped so much.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,"Okay, noted. Last question from me, sir, about the revenue split in our vertical business. So if you could share the revenue split for FY ’23?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,Shrikant will…,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,Revenue split?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,"Yes, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,This Total Transport has achieved the top line of INR522 crores and INR68 crores [Phonetic] is of OneWorld Logistics Private Limited of last mile delivery.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,"Okay. And what exactly are the growth drivers, which is, you know, contributing to the revenue, if you could highlight on that?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,Of Total Transport you mean to say?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,"Yes, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"This growth highlight is the same that is a month of December and Jan we had a big business for the Russia and some to CIS destination and it was a quite big number of containers we moved there and that was with the different margins what we had. So this is one of the biggest highlight, I mean biggest thing happen, good thing happen to us. Secondly, if you see the rate levels started dropping from the month of November or December onwards. So we almost have three quarters of sizable rate levels are in the market. So we started dropping from the December onwards and now it is almost coming to the bottom. So the first, I could say, almost eight to nine months, we had a good margin due to different rate levels, which was offered by the shipping lines. And same being the selling rate was quite good in those times, first eight to nine months. So these are the basic good contributors for our pipeline. Though our volume rather slowed down or value of the transaction has slowed down, but we could manage to see a close of our previous year’s top line, which was INR528 crores. And we actually did this year INR522 crores. So there was a marginal difference. That’s where whole our focus and activity wise push what we did into the previous figures.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,"Okay. Okay, sir. Thank you for your answer, sir. And you mentioned about the competitions or challenges that business might be facing. So if you could explain me how are you addressing those challenges in the market to keep up again?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"Okay. See the only way we have to do is to step up our sales effort. We have — we are in the process. We have hired nearly five sales, additional sales and customer services and which has contributed to the increase in volumes and we are in the process of hiring some more. In the initial stages, the cost will be a little up, but for sure in the next six months we will have recovered those costs and gone ahead of what we have planned.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Daniel —  — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Okay, sir. Thank you so much for all the insights and I wish you the very best.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,Thank you.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,Thank you very much.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Rohan Mehta [Phonetic], an individual investor. Please go ahead.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"Yes, good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. Sir, you mentioned about the freight charges having, you know, gone up because of which we’ve had a dip in revenue and profit. So what can be expect, coming couple of quarters are freight charges expected to continue to increase or remain flat or any views?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"First, you have got it incorrect, because freight charges haven’t gone up. The freight charges have gone down.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"Right, right. Sorry, I meant the other way round, because of which we have been —",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"Because our turnover comprises of the freight. So once the freight charges drop, our turnover also goes down. Now having said that, we don’t expect any dip further because it is already bottomed up. For the next two quarters, we expect that it will be more or less on the same level, maybe 5% here and there from the freight level. And from January, it is expected that China will be in full swing of production. The economies would revive a bit in Europe and U.S., and then we will see some upward revision in the freight levels because these freight levels are not congenial to operate vessels for the shipping lines, you know. So it is like bottomed up. These are my views, can go down by 5% here and there but not more than that. So now it is a matter of how we market, how we sell and how we get more business.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"Okay, and maybe January onwards some improvement can be…?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,That is what is expected.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"Right, right. Okay. And sir, so on an average what is the sort of average number of shipments that we are doing per month, roughly?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"See, I would not talk about average number of shipment, but I will talk about average number of containers that we took and those are about 3,000 containers a month.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"3,000 a month. All right, sir. And amongst LCL and FCL, which segment gets us higher margins?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,LCL.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"LCL. And so what, do we have a rough breakup of LCL and FCL?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,Our LCL is about 65% to 70%.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,Okay. And that will remain the same break up?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"More or less — no, I wouldn’t say that the breakup will remain the same because we see a growth in FCLs in the coming days. LCL globally constitutes just 1.25% of the global business. So whatever it goes up, it is a very miniscule percentage of growth. We can’t expect a huge growth in LCL, but if we have to do well, we have to increase our FCL to those levels and maintain profitably and the supply also. And that is what we are working on.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"If FCL contribution to revenue increases, then overall margin would slightly get affected because as you said, FCL would be a relatively lower margin than LCL?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"Yes, of course, but at the same time, when there is not much of increase in the LCL business, we cannot be just sitting and looking at better margins, right? We have to increase our turnover. We have to increase our profit. In percentile basis, it may be less, but in actual terms, it will be there.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"Right, right. Fair enough, sir. And sir, this quarter or overall this year how much business have we done from Abhilaya?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"Oh, Srikant can you please?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"This month of April we have achieved 24.50 lakhs shipments that are now of INR6.47 crores and May will be closing a little more, 27 lakhs plus shipment, which should be giving us close to INR6.80 crores turnover, probably more, little more.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,Per month?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"Per month, yes. Okay, and that would be sustainable over the next few quarters?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"Yes, definitely.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"Not only sustainable, it will increase.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"It will increase, okay. And sir, just a couple of other questions. Is there any plan to increase the number of ports under our belt this year?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,You are talking about Total Transport now?,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"Yes, yes.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Shrikant Nibandhe — Director,"See, at this point in time, we are not looking at ports. We are looking at cargo generating centers. You know, like from the cargo units, we want to put up our sales offices. This year, the whole target is to push in more sales. So that is what we are looking at. We, as far as operations are concerned, we are able to handle cargoes Pan-India. We don’t need to add force. We need to add cargoes.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"Cargoes, understood sir. And just a last question, do we have any plans to increase our stake in RN Freight from the current time?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,Not at this point of time.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"And sir, just touching upon Abhilaya once again, as we had sort of launched 50 odd EV scooters under Abhilaya, but they were — as I understand — exclusively for Amazon. So is there anything in the pipeline for some other clients also for last mile delivery?",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,We will be doing it for Flipkart but that will be after second quarter.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"After second quarter, all right.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,"We are — really one of the advantages we are getting with this is [Technical Issues] once we are through with our study, then we will take a call.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Rohan Mehta —  — Analyst,"Okay. All right. Understood, sir. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much and all the best.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Makarand Pradhan — Managing Director,Thank you. Thank you.,TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as that was the last question for today, I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Shrikant Nibandhe, Promoter and Director, for closing comments. Over to you, sir.",TOTAL,Total Transport Systems Limited

Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,Questions and Answers:,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have the first question from the line of Saket Kapoor from Kapoor & Co. Please go ahead.,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,[Foreign Speech].,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,[Foreign Speech],IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Thank you, sir for the opportunity and a good set of number, sir, as as per our last conversation it was conveyed to the investing community that we have hit the peak in terms of the raw material prices and both the benefit of lower raw-material and better realizations will accrue to the number and that is what we have seen for this quarter. Sir, and just taking from gist of what our MD told today at CNBC, so couple of points from where he left there. Firstly, sir, if you could, there was some understanding on the capex part that spoke about capex in two phases. First, the one lakh the one which would be done by 2025 and then for another one lakh. So if you could elaborate what are what is our capex plan for the coming four to five years, sir?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"No, Saket, I think there is some confusion there because MD spoke about one lakh ton of ferro chrome capacity will be coming up online in second quarter of calendar year FY 2025, again he spoke about the an year one lakh ton. So I think there is some confusion there. So as of now what we’re planning is one lakh ton of ferro chrome capacity we then investment of INR550 crores incoming another.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Correct sir. And last year sir we capitalized around INR200 crores in the capital work-in progress, so what would we attribute that INR200 crores, sir?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"N, that is too specific a question, we need to check that one, Saket, send us a mail, we’ll answer that separately.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Okay, okay sir. Sir can you again give us some color on the major raw material especially the coal and the coke prices and how have they paired the met coke I think especially from the from Colombia is the one which we are using because of some specification. So how are the price trend and we also guided for EBITDA margins improving from 22% to 25% for H1, so (22:20) elaborate?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"See, Q4 as far as Q4 is concerned, coal cost, the variable power cost has come down from INR4.77 to INR4.26. And although the coke cost has not come down in Q4 because we are using the old inventory high-cost inventory. But the coke cost has come down. Deepak, would you like to expand on the coke front?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"Yeah, actually we have coke in the INR4.50 level earlier, but that has come down by another $70, $80 at the moment, but that coal will be reset in the Q2 while it will be utilized. So it is coming down with near — it was above 500 which has come down slowly and ultimately we have to — in the Q2, we are seeing a slightly much lower price for the coke particularly for that reason. So impact below $400 we have now booked which we’ll visit in the month of July.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"So we had bought at the peak of $700 in last year and from there it has come down to around $380 now, so as you intimated earlier also the costs are coming down gradually.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,So the benefit of lower coal cost would be accrued from second quarter?,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,In first quarter and second quarter also.,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"The first and the second quarter. Sir, if we look at the lower volume part, there also the MD mentioned that for the sales for the quarter have been 57,000 and there were some inventory at the vendor managed inventory yard. So, if you could elaborate, what would be amount of the stock that would percolate to Q1, sir?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"So, 7,000 tons of ferro chrome were shipped on 30th of March, so billing would be done this quarter, current quarter.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"So, we guess 7,000 ton realization is quarter number two?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Yes, yes, yes, yes.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, if you could also throw some light on the inventory part, sir, that is again the inventory higher because of this one is sir we have inventory at INR337 crore…",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Because that 7,000 tons see again appearing in the inventory.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Correct sir. And lastly about the phospho part sir, earlier because of some natural calamity last time there were some port major for phospho, so are the deliverables now evened out and they have close to that 7,000 ton per month?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,Deepak?,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"Yeah, as you said, the impact it was soft in the month of September phospho major that discussed and from month of January that started kicking at the moment for this quarter also it stood at 21,000 level and going on also it will be in that range as per our content.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"And sir, could you throw some more light on the realization for ferro-chrome currently. And one more request sir, as we see in many company website, there is a provision for the latest update on the international prices of the commodity that the company, our is a single product commodity and for all investors it is not difficult to track the prices, so if a link could be created for us so that on a monthly basis or on a quarterly that is updated, so we can get an idea of how the current ferro-chrome prices are trending, if it is available with key men, but everyone cannot source the same on a real time basis, so it is a request if that could be done for this…",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"That will create more confusion in the investor community because there are different kind of prices for different kind of grade. What we are producing, what the price we are quoting you don’t know, so that might get more confusion.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Okay, sir. So then what are the current realization and how has been the contract done if you could give some color on the same?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Deepak, would you help us on that?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"It is similarly around one lakh 20 around, it will be for this quarter which is slightly higher than the last quarter [Indecipherable] higher than the last quarter for that reason, last quarter in Q4 it was 116 or 117 around. And this quarter, it will be around 119, 120, one lakh 20.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,120 will be the realization for Q1?,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"Right metric, yeah.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED

Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Correct sir. And sir, you did spoke about this renewable tie-up also going ahead, I think so we have currently 5 megawatt from the solar, so going ahead sir are we looking for this open access source forum that had been availed by the government going ahead or what kind of capex do we envisage going ahead to have renewable tie-up?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Bijayan, I would request you to answer that one?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Bijayananda Mohapatra — Chief Operating Officer,"For our — that upcoming project, we have to get power through renewable energy that will be hybrid system, that means solar plus wind. So we are going for 50 MW capacity and that will be captive on our token assets, it will be captive, so we taking care on that one, so we’ll get benefits, we are being a captive either.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED

Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Okay. Coal India did announce some increase in coal prices, will that affect, how…",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Binoy Agarwalla — Head of Power Business Unit,"Coal India has increased, I mean given the notification from G2 to G10, but we are using G12, G13 coal, so there will be no impact on G12 and G13.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"And lastly on the OTS part, Prem sab, it was — the settlement has happened at INR52 crores and we were emphasizing it at INR71 crores. So that understanding is correct sir for post…",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"No, INR71 crore amount we have to pay that we have paid, so that was the amount to be paid, not the settlement amount. But we have booked INR52 crore I think so, INR52 crore and quality provided for INR26 crore in the books already, so the balance I didn’t provide it now.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Okay. And now the issue is put to rest, sir?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Sorry, amount to…",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Now the issue is put to rest, now we don’t have any other contingency right now?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"No, no, I think the final settlement we have to enter into with them.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Other than this sir, any other contingencies line-item we have on that is pending to be resolved in the near-future?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"There are other items also, there are other items also, so we are kind to resolve them.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor & Co. — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Sir, I’ll join the queue, sir. And thank you and all the best to the team sir, going ahead, sir, for the AGM also I think the notice is not yet, the dates have not been provided [Speech Overlap].",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED

Operator,"We have the next question from the line of Manish Shekhar, an investor. Please go ahead.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Sir, just wanted to understand with cash flow coming in and with the kind of cash flow we’ll get in H1 and H2, we’ll have decent amount of cash on books by the end-of-the year, with market cap at around INR1,500 crores and perhaps INR260 crores already in the books and maybe some more coming through. Would you think buyback makes sense for enhancing shareholder value at the current prices that the shares are trading at?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"See, Manish, we have lined-up lot of pencil of source, so buyback at this point of time is not sensible in our opinion. So although we are paying good dividends, so by way of dividends we’ll be rewarding shareholders, but buyback I don’t think is feasible at the moment, given the expansion plans we have lined-up.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Sir, but expansion would be how much in terms of value because you had announced INR500 crore?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Around INR2000 crores we are investing in over a period of seven years, so we need to have that cash-flow also in our, we are planning it through internal accruals only.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,So INR2000 crores of total capex over next seven years is what you see?,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Yes, yes.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay. Fine. Thank you so much. Do you think that will increase dividends, perhaps if not buyback?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Yeah, wherever possible, we are trying to give the maximum dividend.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay, one final question in terms of cost of production, what you are seeing now versus Q4?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"That will be difficult to answer at the moment, because it depends on what kind of material we are using when. So I won’t be able to give the exact number for that, but, yeah, it should be lower than Q4.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"So, sale price higher and cost of production lower so that means [Speech Overlap].",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,So Q1 is better than Q4 we are expecting.,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"That means, much better that in fact.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"That is very difficult to pinpoint at the moment too early because it all depends on where the spot prices of ferro chrome and what kind of cost we are going to have. But yes, overall we are expecting better quarter than Q4.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay, thank you sir.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Right, thank you.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vaibhav Badjatya from Honesty And Integrity Investment. Please go ahead.,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Vaibhav Badjatya — Honesty And Integrity Investment — Analyst,"Hi, sir, thanks for providing the opportunity. Sir just few questions from a longer-term perspective. So if you can help us understand how ferro chrome convention stainless steel series 200, 300, 400 differs, that will just help us understand how the demand can fluctuate going forward, so if you can just highlight it would be…",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Deepak, would you answer that one?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"So, let’s say, nobody can sell, but let me tell you the 2022 calendar year, stainless steel output was at 55.255 million tons which is which was lower by 3 million tons from the previous year that is 2021, but all credit itself are there that in the current year 2023, it would be reaching a new height of 60 million ton. So once the stainless steel is picking-up, totally ferro chrome has to go up, ferro chrome demand and as such no stainless steel ferro chrome is used mostly in stainless steel and the [Indecipherable] particularly in India is still in the range of 2 to 2.5, while the international standard or pretty developed countries it is there around 15 kgs and China has this almost around 10 kgs. So even if and with the government interventions and AatmaNirbhar all those things without a kind of project since Government of India has undertaken moment towards that. So naturally if it gets doubled also, ferro chrome will be in demand. So that’s why I told…",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Vaibhav Badjatya — Honesty And Integrity Investment — Analyst,"Yeah, I understand that, sir, but what I was trying to understand is that how the ferro chrome consumption differs between different grades of steel, which is between 200, 300 and 400 [Speech Overlap] kind of thing that would be great.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"So basically ferro chrome congestion varies between 12% to 30% and lowest 10% to 12% in 200 cities and 400 cities this above 25 plus, so that’s highest category and is well versed and depending upon what grade of ferro chrome you are using because internationally India produces around 50%, but South Africa produces around 40% to 50% and certainly like Tajikistan they produce more than 60%, so it depends that percentage what I had told, so I told in the context of mostly 60%.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Vaibhav Badjatya — Honesty And Integrity Investment — Analyst,"Okay. Got it. And as I understand some of the ferro chrome manufacturing capacity in India is flexible to shift to even manganese coal. So if you can just highlight what is the total ferro chrome capacity and out of that how much, how much is actually shift able to manganese depending upon the economics between manganese and ferro chrome, if you can help us understand that.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"So let me tell you, niche furnace which is producing ferro chrome can produce silico manganese or ferro manganese with minus 10 not much thing anything can get over. So at the moment ferro chrome capacity which has been utilized is in the range of 1.7 million tons. So and we are producing around 1.3 million tons in India. So depending upon the market scenario, those who are not integrated may shift to some quantity method to basically manganese alloys, that has happened in past also, they have gone to manganese and come back to chrome depending upon the market scenario.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Vaibhav Badjatya — Honesty And Integrity Investment — Analyst,"Got it, understand. And lastly, sir, from a longer-term perspective, is then anyway you are seeing that this trend of electric vehicle that is surely creeping in everywhere across the world is going to have an impact on the supply for on a global supplier of UG2 mine which actually determines a price for our mining portion of our business. So we think that there is an link and this trend versus we can impact either positively or negatively to us or long-term?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Do you have any idea about that, I don’t think [Speech Overlap].",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,I don’t see there is a link between we versus UG2 chrome view because that’s not relevant…,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Vaibhav Badjatya — Honesty And Integrity Investment — Analyst,"Sir, I was coming from the perspective that UG2 is mind only mainly because of good metals and in AV is the ratio of platinum group metal usage is very low, so I was coming from that point-of-view that over long-term do you see any impact on that?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"Actually, I don’t think so. In South Africa even if platinum grew we are pretty simple to from other side also, they are getting tailings from which they are making use it too kind of fees. So I don’t think it will impact.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Vaibhav Badjatya — Honesty And Integrity Investment — Analyst,"Okay, got it. And sir, lastly, is there any other alternate to ferro chrome usage in system, is there any other alternate metal or something that can be viewed, so there is no alternate?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"I don’t think there is any alternate because stainless property comes from chrome basically which to some scrap is used, stainless steel scrap, so because in the scrap also stainless steel scrap to get the chrome as well as we get. So to some extent, but it is not major margin ferro-chrome is required.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Vaibhav Badjatya — Honesty And Integrity Investment — Analyst,"Okay. Got it, sir, that’s it from my side. Thank you. Thanks for answering all the…",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Operator,Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Sagar Gandhi from Future Generali Life Insurance. Please go ahead.,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Sagar Gandhi — Future Generali Life Insurance — Analyst,"Yeah, sir my first question is on the thermal coal cost. So we have seen prices of thermal coal globally going down. So, sir, your guidance of INR26 per ton for Q1 is it not slightly conservative in estimate considering your Q4 cost at similar levels?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,Binoy?,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Binoy Agarwalla — Head of Power Business Unit,"Actually, I have, I told you, Q4 2028 average of possibly we get in MCF is around INR2600, but in Q4 MCL the weighted-average is INR2800. And we have linkage option back size is quite low, because if we are getting coal from linkage that weighted-average is around INR2700. If we are not getting sufficient cold from linkage, that is the reason why we are going spot auction, spot auction coal price is high, so weighted average of MCL cost is going high.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Sagar Gandhi — Future Generali Life Insurance — Analyst,"Sir, what is the normal proportion between spot and linkage, I mean, contribution from both?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Binoy Agarwalla — Head of Power Business Unit,"We have linkage as per our required quantity per annum we have linkage, but in case we are not getting linkage, linkage coal from MCL, then we are going for spot auction. In Q4, we had bought only 5000 of spot auction, but in Q3 we had gone for 30,000 around 30,000 of spot auction, it depends how it comes from MCL.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Sagar Gandhi — Future Generali Life Insurance — Analyst,"But normally whatever is our consumption fifty-fifty comes from both avenues, is that the broad understanding?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Binoy Agarwalla — Head of Power Business Unit,"No, no, it is not 50-50, suppose we are getting as for our required quantity from linkage auction then we need not to buy it from spot auction because spot auction price is quite high, it is ranging from 5000 to 6000.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Sagar Gandhi — Future Generali Life Insurance — Analyst,"Okay. Okay and sir, what was your volume number for Q4?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,Ferrochrome?,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Sagar Gandhi — Future Generali Life Insurance — Analyst,Ferro chrome?,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"It’s around 64,000 [Speech Overlap].",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Binoy Agarwalla — Head of Power Business Unit,"Q4 is 61,200.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED

Operator,"Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Joe Shah from Seven Seas, please go ahead.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Joe Shah — Seven Seas — Analyst,"Prem, I have some question for you. Number one, as you said that sales growth particularly 53,162 ton in Q4 and 7,000 ton versus 30th of March, so which is to be, yet to be invoiced?So now in the form of inventory in-transit [Indecipherable] how come this reduction in work in progress and finished goods inventory by INR28.50 crore actually this should have gone up, now your inventory has gone down by INR28.50 crores. So this is a one question and second question is, what is the status of utkal fee value attempt report from export community was to repay this and price this valuation report, so what is happening with the report, that is two question.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"So this report has not yet come, we are still waiting for that report, the valuer has not given the report and we are putting pressure on them to really as soon as possible. They were suppose to call us in the end of May for the settlement that has not happened, so maybe in the month of June we should be getting, we should be getting invitation from the Ministry to for discussion. And as far as changes in inventory is concerned, I think it is we are showing decrease in inventory, we are showing around INR29 crore compared to INR50 crore because in Q3 also we had lot of inventory which we have liquidated in this quarter, okay?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"So, maybe because of that you are seeing this number.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Joe Shah — Seven Seas — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. Prem about this pay local PA that value report discussion in June you are saying in June, July, but after that they will straightaway make the payment or there will be some discussion?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"That part I’m not aware of, what process they are going to follow, after the discussion, once we agree to the value, then we should be getting back money, but the process at the government level is going to be cumbersome, maybe 15, 20 days they will take in raising the money.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Joe Shah — Seven Seas — Analyst,"That is repayable 15, 20 days, 30 days either or we have waited for so many months?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Yeah, I’m not aware of that part, so that is the government process, they will take their own time.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Joe Shah — Seven Seas — Analyst,"Right. So Deepak two questions for you, export on ferro chrome piping and everything. Now, we understand that the China ferro chrome prices are improving because of port usage some scarcity is there and demand is also improving. And China ferro chrome portion is going down and due to price is also strong. So it is over rule also this Chinese ferro chrome pipe is improving, so what you think about ferro chrome piping next two quarter?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"Actually ferro chrome prices which we look at I mean ferro chrome price, if you look April to May towards that low level and May to June they have it has gone up by RMB200 correct?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Joe Shah — Seven Seas — Analyst,Right.,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"So RMB200 means it is around 2.3%, but the exchange rate, the Chinese currency RMB has depreciated by around 3% from if you look at initial opening up May or mid May, let’s say three and now, it has grown from 6.9 to 7.10 already, okay? So effective price has really not gone up. It is if you convert it for because international transactions are ultimately done in dollar terms. So in that nearly not much gone up, and as such, because of the Euro, it’s not in good position, they are also dependent on price in there construct some activities that has not yet cashed up so far. So, but looking at the things it should improve and as you are telling UG2 prices have gone up, so there is cost pressure on ferrochrome producers in in China so have to go up, but this is the timing depending upon how the demand pans out, less the reasons demand supplies under it can go up, that’s the way I look at it.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Joe Shah — Seven Seas — Analyst,"Okay. Now before one more question about our Therubali, Therubali smelter because of distance I think now Therubali distance from chromite mines in Sukinda, I think Therubali is grouping importance they are more focused on Choudwar area, is there possibility of our testing Therubali power from ferro chrome to ferro memory is there possibility, so that we can utilize our impact say in Therubali?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"So we have highlighted many time, but as you know manganese robe is not available in India, it’s all import based and you have to be close to the port because all manganese set ups in India either it is near Vizag port or near Calcutta port mostly. So logistical cost and otherwise it will not be [Indecipherable] going and as per we have to utilize our own chrome and we are utilizing always that maximum thereafter only you are using that [Indecipherable], so effectiveness so working up.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Joe Shah — Seven Seas — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Okay. Now, Prem, regarding this renewable energy plant, it — this Kalinga Nagar our person from power was saying that about 50 MW will be in tolling, INR800 crore, so that is very good amount and therefore 50-50 MW if we’re able to catch-up INR100 crore investment that is a very good campaign to thermal, it’s very much cheaper, so how long it will take the 50%…",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Joe, bhai, you understood it wrongly, we are not fitting away renewal power plant in Kalinga Nagar, we are are entering into a captive consumption with a party we are setting up and we are just going to continue our 25%, 26% equity in bag, which should amount to around INR100 crore.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Joe Shah — Seven Seas — Analyst,"Okay, okay [Speech Overlap]. So we ill be outsourcing our renewable power from that third party?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,Yes.,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Joe Shah — Seven Seas — Analyst,"Okay, okay, okay, okay. Right, Prem, last question, regarding this Q1 FY 2024, as you said that real as we’ve improved to about 1,20,000 and also cost of coal is also going down. So can we generalize that Q1 will be much better than the Q4?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,That I’ve already told that Q1 should be better than Q4.,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED

Operator,"Yes, please go ahead. Thank you.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Yeah, congratulations on a robust performance. So my first question is, what could be our cost of production for Q4?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Q4 cost of production would be around 78,000, 79,000.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,Okay. And what do you expect that numbers going forward in Q1 FY 2024?,IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"As I said, it would be very difficult to give any pinpoint number for that. What we can give a guidance that it will be lower than Q4.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay, okay.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Very, very difficult, yeah, somehow it will be very difficult to calculate now.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay. Sir, one question regarding South Africa. So after the ramp rise in power prices, our ferro chrome smelters still viable in South Africa. So what would be roughly the breakeven cost because during correction of ferro chrome prices, news of putting about shutting down of plant so if you could just throw some light on that?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"Deepak, would you answer that?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Deepak Mohanty — Head of Ferro Alloys Business Unit,"Yeah, let me tell you, actually South Africa and ferro chrome production with the power cost higher than the other page, they are much viable than China because you know out of total 15 million tons stand up which is around 7 million tons which is at a much higher cost, which is [Indecipherable] from South Africa and then convert into China. So that’s where that advantage is always there with the South African products, as far as chrome cost is concerned, it is a major part and reductions also in China is quite low, South Africa. So they are always cost-competitive that [Indecipherable] mainly it’s with the power availability, but you must have hard that power situation in South Africa is extremely bad and now there will be [Indecipherable] to Nagar, there winter is coming, where the tariff is higher, as well as it is going to be the instead of power crisis which means in a turn of 32 hours 16 hours black out. So we have to see how things are coming out, there were power crisis its not the rate what capex spend, availability can change the ferro chrome prices then actually in a different way and hence it can increase, step up prices in South Africa types.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay, okay thanks sir. On Utkal fee if you could give a revised timeline for when do you expect the amount?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"That would be very difficult to give in tandem, madam, because you see last six months we are expecting this many to come, but government is taking its own sweet time, so very difficult. They were suppose to call us in end of May, this is that has not happened. So maybe in June the discussion will happen and then next quarter we can expect in-the-money. But again, you see those are again expected things government is taking their own time.",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Sir, my last question is what take up a unit power cost for this quarter?",IMFA,INDIAN METALS & FERRO ALLOYS LIMITED

Prem Khandelwal — Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary,"No, no, not like that to agree, it will be basically in COVID, the quantity, the quantity which we have set in the month of by end of period end March, basically that win for the twin that lateral we made those spend that was going ahead. So it will not be an additional quantity that way, it will be in that range only, 64,000 total.

"Ajit Kumar — Director, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Q4 FY’23 revenue saw another quarter with strong growth both on quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Revenue of INR965 crores grew by 5.1% quarter-over-quarter and by just under 40% year-over-year. Given that Tourism segment with relatively lower margin was the key driver for quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, the overall EBITDA margin, 33.6% versus 35.5% quarter-over-quarter and 41.4% year-over-year. However, we have been able to maintain the absolute EBITDA almost at Q3 FY’23 levels. Net profit before exceptional items for Q4 FY’23 came at INR253 crores versus INR254 crores in Q3 FY’23 and INR200 crores in Q4 FY’22.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
"Ajit Kumar — Director, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Let us move to the business segment. Now the first one, Internet Ticketing segment that continues to demonstrate its resilience and with conversion of reserved tourist ticket back to unreserved tickets during the past pre-pandemic period, revenue for the quarter was at INR295 crores which declined by just 2% quarter-over-quarter and whilst grew by 0.8% year-over-year. However, EBIT margin came at 38.1% versus 34.2% quarter-over-quarter and 91.5% year-over-year.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd

EBIT margin for the segment improved further to 13.5% versus 10.8% quarter-over-quarter and a loss on year-on-year basis. In Q4 FY’23, the revenue share of the Tourism segment increased to 21.1% versus 16.1% quarter-over-quarter and 11.6% year-over-year. As you would note, given that the EBIT margin for the segment is lower than the company average, it has resulted in the moderation of overall margin profile of the quarter.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
"Ajit Kumar — Director, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Now next important segment, Rail Neer. Rail Neer saw Q4 FY ’23 revenue of INR17.1 crores, implying a decline of 6.7% quarter-over-quarter and a growth of 35.2% year-over-over.

"Ajit Kumar — Director, Finance and Chief Financial Officer",Questions and Answers:,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jinesh Joshi from Prabhudas Lilladher Private Limited. Please go ahead.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Jinesh Joshi — Prabhudas Lilladher Private Limited — Analyst,"Thanks for the opportunity. Initially, if you can help me with the convenience revenue for the quarter and also the number of the tickets booked.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,Can you please come again? Your voice initially was not audible.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Jinesh Joshi — Prabhudas Lilladher Private Limited — Analyst,Am I audible now?,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes, you are better.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Jinesh Joshi — Prabhudas Lilladher Private Limited — Analyst,"Yeah. So madam, I wanted to know what was the convenience revenue and the total number of tickets booked for the quarter?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Okay. The first — I will answer your second question first. The number of tickets booked in the first — this last quarter, that is January ’23 to March ’23 has been — total tickets have been nearly 10.44 crores tickets — number of tickets have been looked and 14.54 crores passengers have been booked on these tickets. And then you said the revenue from this, total INR802 crores was the total revenue of the ticketing in the entire financial year. And in the last quarter, the convenience fee that we have received is nearly INR197 crores in the last quarter.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Jinesh Joshi — Prabhudas Lilladher Private Limited — Analyst,"Sure, madam. Thank you. My second question is with respect to our Catering business. So if I remember correctly, our Catering reach was approximately INR1,203 including TSV and pantry car until the last quarter. So the question is, have we been able to extend the count over here? And also, what is the total opportunity size in terms of number of trains that we can service. So basically, I thought of asking this question as not all suburban trains would require catering support, especially the ones that ply on the short distance, so yeah, your thoughts on this.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"See, before COVID, we were having nearly 417 trains if you recall correctly. Now these 417 trains will be pantry car. So now the 417 trains figure has increased, and we have now the contracts available for 492 trains, which has been awarded by IRCTC till the last month. In addition to these 492 trains, we also have a Train Side Vending contracts available for nearly for 675 touch screens. And many of — I think more than 300 train contracts is in — still in the pipeline because we are — as of now, we are going for our short-term tenders. And this is a continuous process and every — after every six months the cycle repeats. So as of now, you can see more than 1,100 trains are available with the IRCTC on contract. Out of which more — nearly 50% trains are with the pantry car and rest of the trains are under Train Side Vending.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Jinesh Joshi — Prabhudas Lilladher Private Limited — Analyst,"Sure, madam. Just one follow-up on this side. You mentioned that more than 1,100 trains are available, but I wanted to know the opportunity size, so —",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"All Vande Bharats which are coming are being added as a fleet. Our contracts are being awarded by the IRCTC, that is one addition. Any new trains being operated by Indian Railways, the contracts are being awarded by IRCTC only. So we have a rights — you can say that so far, I think Honorable Prime Minister has announced that 75 new Vande Bharats are going to be operated. Out of which, I think 20 have started. All such operations are being looked at by IRCTC. The more trains are going to be there in the pipeline, the more services are going to be available for IRCTC.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Jinesh Joshi — Prabhudas Lilladher Private Limited — Analyst,"Sure, madam. One last question from my side. That is on the balance sheet, especially pertaining to the receivable days. So if I remember correctly, in the past, we had worked out in the Indian Railways whereby majority of the payment pertaining to catering also happened on the day of the service itself, which essentially should have led to an improvement in our receivable cycle so to say. But apparently, if I look at our receivable days for FY’23, it is at about 118-odd which is not materially different than the past. So has the change really come into effect?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"There was a software to be made. Ministry of Railway decided, even yesterday also there was a testing. If everything goes well with the testing, it is likely to be started in the coming month. So we — as our services are booked for a train, accordingly the customer will be paying online. So we would be receiving nearly 68.5% of that revenue directly the next day. So that testing is being done. Our team is also involved. The testing is in place, you will find some changes in the preceding months — in the forthcoming months.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Jinesh Joshi — Prabhudas Lilladher Private Limited — Analyst,"Got it. So basically, our receivables cycle should improve going ahead, it’s my understanding.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"It will rather, because we are going to get — earlier you used to get the amount after 120 days. And after 120 days, sometimes it is taken by the railways to reimburse the amount. So we had a lead time of more than six months in getting, that is why you are saying six months. So maybe now as soon as the ticket is booked, journey may be after 120 days but at least 58% of the revenue will be available with you. That program has been developed by our technical body in place. It is being tested by railway finance. It is being tested by IRCTC finance and our operational teams too on both the sides.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Jinesh Joshi — Prabhudas Lilladher Private Limited — Analyst,"Sure, madam. Thank you so much and all the best.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,Thank you.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Rohit Bahirwani from Vijit Global Securities Private Limited. Please go ahead.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Bahirwani — Vijit Global Securities Private Limited — Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you for giving me the opportunity. I had a couple of questions. First is, what are your growth plans in Rail Neer segment? The capacity is around 14.8 lakh liters per day and utilization is around 70%. At what levels can we expect it to grow further?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"You said our capacity is nearly 14 lakh liters, but per day production of the Rail Neer is now 15.5 lakh liters a day. We have 15 — 16 plants are in operation. And our Bhubaneswar and Vijayawada is going to the operational soon. And the plants which are being operated by us. We are also thinking of increasing their capacity also. So like we have certain phase available before the plant, so we are trying to increase the capacity of that, but as well, in addition to making the new plants, which are going to be commissioned soon in Bhubaneswar, Vijayawada, Kota and Simhadri.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Bahirwani — Vijit Global Securities Private Limited — Analyst,And what can be the utilization level can we expect in future?,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"As of now, in the last financial year, the fiscal we are talking about, our capacity utilization has been nearly 73.32%. So as that really is picking up, we are increasing our capacity utilization in many of the cases. Yesterday, we also had our cost audit, and it has also observed that the utilization of the plant, capacity utilization has improved a lot as compared to the pre-COVID levels, COVID levels also.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"And we are in process since we are going to increase their capacity also and the utilization of the not only the existing assets but the asset going to be added because since we have to meet the demand, so we’ll have to increase the production from these plants as well. So you will find some good improvement on a better side as well as the capacity utilization is concerned. May and June are the peak periods, July in fact. Now the Rail Neer demand is throughout the year, except for the month when we have winters. So you will find more or less good capacity utilization throughout the year, except for the maintenance days.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Bahirwani — Vijit Global Securities Private Limited — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. And my second question was what’s the update on the payment aggregator license, which is pending since last two quarters? And just wanted to understand, will it help in bringing additional revenues or it will help in cutting down the cost?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"It will help. The payment gateway business, yes, we had applied for the license. We were stuck up in between, many changes had to be made. We are — iPay licensing [Foreign Speech], we had applied to RBI. RBI has given us certain guidelines. We are complying with that guidelines. We are in the process of following. As a follow-up, we are about to submit two papers to them very soon.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"As far as the revenue from the iPay is concerned, let me explain you that our revenue from the payment gateway has been very good this year. This has been nearly INR67.37 crores from the payment gateway. And out of this, the net profit has been around — without GST hedging INR38.09 crores. So the revenue projection is larger. That is why we are going ahead till that time, it is not there we are going with only with PG. We have not stopped the PG work. But an aggregator model, yes, we are going to increase the revenue once we are through. The process is not that simple sir, it requires lots of efforts, that team is — and the entire process has to be rebuilt, so we are doing that. The technical changes are also in the pipeline and as well as our approvals are also in the pipeline. You will hear the good news in the days to come.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Bahirwani — Vijit Global Securities Private Limited — Analyst,Okay. That’s it from my side. Thank you for answering my questions.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jyoti Singh from Arihant Capital Markets Limited. Please go ahead.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Jyoti Singh — Arihant Capital Markets Limited — Analyst,"Yeah, sir, thank you for the opportunity. My question is on the Vande Bharat side. If you can give us a little bit of brief which [Technical Issues] how is the pipeline and which are the companies that we are having contracts if we can disclose? And apart from that, why are other expenses — sorry, why our other income has increased from previous quarter?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"First is that the other income is from the other resources, the interest has gone up.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
"Ajit Kumar — Director, Finance and Chief Financial Officer",And increasing. FD rates.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"And increasing FD rates also. FD rates have improved, so the interest has improved so other income has improved. Answer to your second question, ma’am. The answer to your first question is some light on the Vande Bharat. As far as the operation of the train is concerned, it is controlled by the Ministry of Railways. We know that much as you have read in the newspaper that the trains are going to be inaugurated. The Vande Bharat so far we are operating doing the entire hospitality business, services are being provided by IRCTC on Vande Bharat.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"As of now, we are providing services and nearly 17 Vande Bharat, two were earlier. So these services are there. Many — if railway decides to operate more and more trains, we would be providing services in all. And who would be getting the contract or who’s running the contract may not be that important. Important is the license fee that IRCTC is getting. And rest of the operation part, IRCTC is handling well.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Jyoti Singh — Arihant Capital Markets Limited — Analyst,"Okay. Thank you so much, madam.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Thank you, Jyoti Singh.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Akshay Bhor from Citadel. Please go ahead.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Akshay Bhor — Citadel — Analyst,Am I audible?,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yeah, Akshay ji, you are audible.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Akshay Bhor — Citadel — Analyst,"Ma’am, my question is on the Internet Ticketing business and group as we think about the next year in this business because ultimately this contributes to about 80% of your EBIT contribution. I just want to understand what are the levers from here for you to deliver growth in this business in terms of either Internet penetration increase or number of passengers increase? And how do we think about each of these elements?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"To explain to you, I would like to show you a few figures with you, Akshay. That is the daily average ticket, if you recall, in the first quarter was around 12.73 lakh tickets in a day. When we were having a good number of 12 [Phonetic] lakhs tickets available with us, that was nearly 38%. Subsequently, when the decision was taken, our booking went down to 11.63%. And now in the third quarter, the booking went down further. It was 11.31%. But the average now — but in quarter four, the bookings came back to 11.61%. So the average booking that we are doing is nearly 82% of the total ticket inventory available through online mode.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"And as far as the services’ convenience fee, which is contributing nearly 75% to our profit, so the — more or less the question of the convenience fee remains the same barring INR1 crores or INR2 crores — INR1 crores, INR2 crores or INR3 crores here and there. You can see our revenue from the convenience fee is nearly INR200 crores average on a month. And the total revenue that we have collected from the Internet Ticketing is around INR802 crores in the entire year. So as of now, the booking remains the same, but we are focusing more on the non-convenience fee resources, which have now increased — which are contributing to 33% of the total revenue of the Internet Ticketing, Internet Ticketing business.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Out of it, you can say the total revenue that we have earned through this and business and related business was nearly INR1,200 crores. Out of which INR802 crores, that is 66.94% was contributed by convenience fee, that is your Ticketing business. And the non-convenience fee business is around 33%, sir. So that was earlier, INR337 crores in the last financial year. This year, it is now almost touching the INR400 crores where you find some growth.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"And this growth has been mainly due to many factors. That is our loyalty program has also contributed. Our CG integration has also contributed. Our agent portion has also contributed. Our IT earning has also contributed. So when we see the revenues on the IT business it has to be seen in totality, not alone with the convenience fee, which is 82%. It may increase to 83%, 84% in the years to come. But at the same time, we need to focus upon the non-convenience fee resources, which are the added business — ancillary business to the Internet Ticketing. So our intention is to increase our revenue. They are more and more because — and so not only to retain the Internet Ticketing, but to show us good growth by providing the good services to the customer.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Akshay Bhor — Citadel — Analyst,"Got it, ma’am. And just a clarification, is it then fair to say that looking into the next couple of years, the growth in the Internet Ticketing segment would be largely through non-convenience fee and convenience fee could remain in the same sort of 200-ish kind of range? Is that —",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Volume growth will be there in the ticketing also. As the Internet improves in the country, some marginal improvement happens every year. It was a little fortunate or unfortunate in the COVID days, that growth, which was through be to happen in the years to come happened in one year. So that is why some variation, you can see — some variation in the revenue mix was also seen just after the COVID. And it was a main bread earner during that period.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"As the train increases, the capacity utilization increases. So like Vande Bharats are being guided and more and more days will be added to our revenue will also take us, will go on the higher side gradually. But the margins are going to be little at slower pace as compared to the COVID period. Yes, our focus is going to be more on the non-convenience fee where we are trying to hard, aggregator business is one.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"And our other loyalty programs you might have noticed that we are doing a lot of loyalty programs and we have already opened 53 branches [Phonetic] compared to one previous branch. Then ticketing also we have recently launched the Char Dham ticketing with the other parties, other parties ticketing also, we are focusing. That Char Dham booking is very popular and our payment business is also there, and we are also focusing more on the B2C partner and of course other businesses.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Akshay Bhor — Citadel — Analyst,"Got it, ma’am. And then just one last question from my side. This is again on the convenience fee itself. And ma’am, you could have a decent visibility in terms of what is the likely passenger booked growth in the next couple of years? And as you understand, already the capacity of Indian Railways is so high that you — by adding a few previous trains, it doesn’t move the needle in terms of overall passengers’ travel. Do you have a visibility in terms of what is the growth rate that you could see in terms of passengers booked or traveled in our case?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"As of now, I don’t have the overall picture of passenger traveled on Indian Railways. I can only tell you about the reserved segments. And if we see the —",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Akshay Bhor — Citadel — Analyst,"Yeah, on the reserved segment, yes ma’am. Do you have a visibility of what could be the passenger growth?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"I can tell you. First thing, if you see the January figure, the passengers traveled was 4.85 crores. But in February because of the winter, it has a seasonal variation also, the number of passenger reduced to 4.5 times in the reserved segment. But in the month of March, it increased to 5.0 lakhs. And the number of our trains also decreased correspondingly in the month of February, but increased in the month of March. So we have to see the seasonal variation also, but, yes, there is a scope as the new trains are being netted, more and more customers are getting diverted from the other mode, the Festival rush is also there. The holiday rush is now happening. All trains are full. You will not get reservation in any of the trains these days because the trains are running with full bookings, which is good news for all of us. The more booking, the more revenue to us.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Akshay Bhor — Citadel — Analyst,"Got it, ma’am. Thank you so much for your time.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Thank you, sir.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Rohit Jain from Tara Capital Partners. Please go ahead.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. Can you hear me? Am I audible?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes, Rohit ji, you are audible.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, good morning. So taking off from the last question, you said that on the ticketing side, most of the growth is going to be driven by non-convenience fee and the convenience fee is going to be more or less stable, I mean, it could grow slightly, but the main growth is going to come from non-convenience fee. Can you tell us what is the difference in the margin profile between convenience fee and the non-convenience fee?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"In the convenience fee, when we talk of the — you want me to tell you the productivity margins in that?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"No, no. I mean, like I’m assuming that convenience fee would be your highest margin business. I mean pretty much as the platform business, everything is sort of flows to the bottom line. So just compare to [Indecipherable] like EBIT margin had been anything?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"I got it. I got it. In fact the non-convenience fee, we will have better margins, better than convenience fee. I’ll tell you how. Because while — when we calculate the convenience fee, we need to pay to the trains also for maintaining the infrastructure. The entire infrastructure of that ticketing is costly, so their average expenditure though not as much, but it is certainly more than what we are going to spend in the non-convenience fee resources.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Here, what we are doing, the infrastructure that has been already been placed, on top of that, these are the ancillary services, which is a total bonus business for IRCTC. So here, the expenditure is less and here the expenditure is going to be more. Most of our businesses, like payment gateway, et cetera, their — our expenditure is almost negligible because the infrastructure is already in place. I need not get any additional bandwidth. The only manpower, monitoring resources and the reconciliation expenditure is added to it. That is very meager as compared to the other infrastructure expenditures that we normally do in the Internet Ticketing.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"Understood. And just another related question to last question is that, I guess, about the previous participant might have been trying to ask is, as you said, most of the ticket — trains are already running at full occupancy. It’s difficult to get reservations. So which means pretty much Indian Railways working at peak capacity. And if you look at the budgetary announcement every year, the number of trains being added is the hardly anything as a percentage of the overall days. So given that Internet penetration is pretty much at peak levels, I mean, in the near term 80% to 84% and all the trains are working at full capacity, so what will drive the growth in the ticketing volume? I mean, if you look at on a Y-o-Y basis, should we expect ticketing revenues to be sort of low single-digit to flattish assuming no change in convenience fee?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"It may not be exactly flattish. It will have some seasonal variations and the festival variations, of course.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"No, no. I’m talking on a Y-o-Y basis, like if we consider the full year, that will rule out the seasonality, right? I mean if we take the whole year versus the next year, the seasonality will adjust itself.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes. There is some growth sector associated with the Internet Ticketing. And as the more and more awareness is happening, the growth kind of item may not be that sharper. It will go at — still grow, but grow at a slow pace.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,Yeah. So that’s what I said. Is it fair to say that it would be low single-digit types?,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Sir, we have already come back 82%. There is going to be a growth, but growth will be at a little — the sector will be a little less. And that is why we would be focusing more on the non-convenience fee resources. You can’t presume that we to have — we still have an off-line model available for the persons who are not blacklisted. We should have because it is a services time Indian Railways has offered services from all the more Internet Ticketing is one. There will be a transition of the customer from off-line mode to online mode like all businesses, which is also going to happen. So that transition, we will be a beneficiary. But at the same time, just to keep the momentum up, we would be focusing more and more on the other businesses. So that our total revenue from this segment, that is Internet segment remains on the top notch.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"Understood. And can you just help us understand the, let’s say, a stable or steady-state margin in the Catering business? That margin has fluctuated pretty sharply over the last few quarters. So going forward, what can we expect in terms of a stable margin for that business?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Catering is now contributing nearly 41% of our revenue this financial year it has contributed. So our margins have been more or less same as we had earlier, that is 10% to 12%, depending upon segments. So giving our margin almost it is going to be in that side also, except for the e-ticketing where we have a 15% margin.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"Right. So more or less, going forward, also 10% to 12% should be the steady-state range for the Catering business.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes. You can say, sir.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"And just last question, what drove the sharp increase in the Tourism revenue quarter-on-quarter?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"You should be happy with that, sir?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"No. Just trying to understand. We’re happy, but we’re just trying to understand.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"[Speech Overlap] The domestic tourism is on its boom, right? And I think I would like to apply this out that IRCTC earlier was running into — only into the budget tourism and we were in the luxury tourism as well. We have come up with the new model of the business after Ministry of Railway has announced that the scheme called Bharat Gaurav scheme under Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat Scheme announced by Ministry — Honorable Prime Mister has taken this initiative, and in this Ministry of Railways has announced the scheme Bharat Gaurav where we have [Indecipherable]. These [Indecipherable] have been customized and put it into the operations.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"So this new segment has been added. Earlier we were operating only 80 trains in a year, 80 to 90 trains in a year in the budget segment. Now we would be running nearly 300 trains in a year. And each train is contributing to nearly INR50 [Phonetic] lakhs of our revenue. And out of which, yes, of course, some expenditure of the railway and IRCTC and the service provider is also there. But a good margin of 10% is left with us.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"So you can say that we have operated many such trains. We did a lot of domestic tourism, and we competed with the open market, we could drive lot many customers to IRCTC and State Teertha also contributed into that, so we could goodwill and the results are in front of you. And in the years to come, this Bharat Gaurav is going to add a revenue not less than INR250 crores alone from this segment. But used to be nearly INR60 crores to INR70 crores only in the previous year. So you can anticipate good growth in the tourism.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"Understood. And just last question. And thanks for answering all the questions. Given that future growth is going to be driven more by, let’s say, non-convenience fee, things like Bharat Gaurav and Catering, which are, let’s say, 10% to 12% margin business, at what level should we expect the overall margins to settle? I’m assuming it’s going to be lower than the 33%, 34%, 36% that we are used to? So can you help us understand what would be the margins going forward?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"You can expect the same results, sir.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"I mean, even if the mix of non-convenience fee increases in the overall revenue mix, the margin is not going to come down?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes. Yes, I agree, sir. It can be even better in the non-convenience fee, resources are doing pretty well and the Bharat Gaurav segment, the way it has picked up the market and the brand equity of the IRCTC has improved in this segment. And we are getting full cooperation everywhere and good number of bookings are happening, and the revenue in this segment put together is going to be high and the margins are also going to improve.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"No, no, ma’am, what I’m trying to understand is the, let say, the Catering business and the Bharat Gaurav business, to set up a 10%, 12% margin business. So as their proportion in the overall revenue goes up, even though the absolute numbers might go up, but margins will settle lower, right?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes. Likely things will be there. But at the same time, absolute number will go up. So the ultimate —",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,"Yeah, yeah, that I understand. I’m not asking that. I’m just trying to — from a modeling perspective, I’m just trying to understand, is there a margin number that we are working with? Is there a visibility there? Is there some visibility there?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,If we are able to do even better in the non-convenience fee resources so that is going to compensate.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rohit Jain — Tara Capital Partners — Analyst,Understood. Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot. Thanks for answering all the questions. Thank you.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,Thank you.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Rahul Jain. Please go ahead.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,"Yeah, is my line audible?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yeah, yeah, Rahul ji, it is audible.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,"Yeah. Congratulations on very good numbers. Ma’am, just a couple of things I need to check. Firstly, on the catering side, can we see all normalization related to that lean period, peak period related reconciliation on catering license fee is done?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"We have completed for the peak period, and for RSG trains, we have done. For the lean period, it is still on. And for the Mail/Express train it is still on. We have not been able to complete that exercise because we started a little late. And we are still in process maybe in the lean period we will — the team is going to complete that soon.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,Okay. And regarding this —,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Rahul ji, you might have seen in the remarks that the invoices that we have seen some impact on the results also which are going to be on the — which was on a good side. Accordingly, the demand notices was given to our licensees, many of them have disputed also, we are resolving those disputes first before the money gets realized. So we are in — very much in the process and actively in the process.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,"Sure, sure. And in the Ticketing business, since the 2S normalization is largely done with, what should be the growth potential here in the convenience fee side?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Convenience fee will have — the convenience fee as compared to the previous year, it has grown up because the number of passengers have gone up. The overall passengers traveled on Indian Railways is going to increase because many new trains have been added. And when you see new trains are being run during the season, festivals, extra trains are being operated. So we have already seen the growth as compared to the previous year in spite of the fact we got second at mandatory provision dissociated in the quarter, first quarter itself, but more or less — I think more or less uniform results were there. But as far as the growth is there, growth is going to be happen — going to happen. It is going to happen more in the non-convenience fee, which has given better margins, so the overall earnings from this segment is going to be on a better side. That is what my — our perception is.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,"Right. And if you could share some basic data on the convenience fee side, basically, average selling price for the quarter, mix of AC, mix of UPI, those kind of metrics?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes, I’ll certainly share. See, our total contribution in the last quarter, the quarter we have — quarter four that we are discussing, the Sleeper Class has been 42.87% [Phonetic]. The Second S is more or less at the pre-COVID level that is 12.52%. And the Third AC is around 28.29% and Second AC is about 6.93%, just very small amount. So this is the breakage as far as the class wise is concerned.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"And the UPI transaction is contributing nearly 33% now. As you know, that the average UPI transaction in this year has been 33% as compared to the previous year when it was 31%. And before that is 24%. So the overall increase in the UPI transaction is also impacting this. So there — that is what your — I think I’ve answered your question.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,"Yes. Yes. And ma’am, on the non-convenience part within the ticketing, any two, three key segments which are sizable, if you could quantify them and the drivers for them going forward?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yeah. You will find the increase in the revenue in the loyalty program. And of course, I say the payment gateway business, you will see some improvement — further improvement, then you will also see our results. Aggregator license comes through, then you will see further improvement in that business. And advertisement revenue has shown a good improvement where we have nearly INR67.41 crores from brand advertising business. That growth may continue and we may do even better because this year is going to be very important. That is in the Internet segment.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"But in the other segment, in the Tourism, yes, Bharat Gaurav is going to have. IRCTC has a very interesting mix of the revenue. It keeps on changing, but the overall absolute thing, as you know, Rahul ji, you are a better judge that we end up landing always in a good numbers. Maybe the revenue mix may change. So this year, the Tourism may also show a good improvement because earlier the revenue from the Bharat Gaurav type trains used to be nearly INR60 crores. Now, it is going to nearly INR250 crores and the margins are going to increase. Absolute numbers also will increase. The loyalty fee in the Internet Ticketing, we are going to show a jump and in E-catering we’ll also show some improvement. Overall, there’s going to be a very good picture and very good future for our investors in IRCTC.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,Thanks. And one more question on the Tourism side. Can you share the metrics for Tejas in terms of revenue frequency?,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Tejas has done well this year. The overall revenue that we received from Tejas has been INR155 [Phonetic] crores. And operating expenses has been INR130 crores. So put together, both Tejas has given a revenue — net profit of INR24.3 crores. And occupancy level of Ahmedabad Tejas has been nearly 81% and Lucknow Tejas has been nearly 69%.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,"81% and 69% what you said, is it?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,Yes. That is occupancy level.,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,Right. And what’s the situation on some of the businesses which are on the Tourism segment led by overseas traveler like Maharaja and Buddhist circuit?,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Maharaja has also done very well this year. Last year, it was with COVID. So we could get only INR2.84 crores when we run two charter. But this year, we have been able to get nearly INR55.38 crores from Maharaja, which is a good number and number of our packs that we have traveled is the highest in the country in the luxury segment.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"In the air ticketing also as compared to the earlier revenue of INR8.54 crores in the previous year, we are having INR23.04 crores in this year. So other business in the air ticketing also has done well. And this year also segment has also picked up as compared to the INR30 crores of the previous year. This year, we have done INR153 crores. So entire — put together, the Tourism business has given us revenue of INR555.98 crores as compared to INR187.89 of the previous year. And we can expect more growth in this business because of the Bharat Gaurav being added in the seat.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,"Right. Just last bit on the state, comment that you made, ma’am. I think we generally see some more traction in the election period. So do we expect this since general as well as some state elections has come?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"Like any other tourism product, it is also subject to seasonal variation, so I can only answer this at this time. Sir, it all depends on states, whether they want to spend their fund in this direction or not. But generally, people work in this direction. So we hope for the good.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Dolat Capital Markets Private Limited — Analyst,"Right. Thank you. Thanks for the color and it’s great being be associated with you for so long. Thank you so much for your guidance through this period. Thank you, ma’am.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd

Madhuchanda Dey — Moneycontrol — Analyst,Yeah. So my question is what is your take on the growth in Catering and Rail Neer for the next two years? What will be the driver? And what kind of growth rate can we expect?,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"We would be on the positive side in the Rail Neer where we would be starting our two plants very soon, Bhubaneswar and Simhadri, we are going to start these plants. Further, we are upgrading the capacity of the existing plant also, so we are going to increase our production Secondly, we are going to improve our capacity utilization by doing some operational measures. So our performance in the Rail Neer is going to be better side. As of now, we are producing nearly 15.52 lakh liters a day, which we would be increasing taking up to nearly 17 lakh liters per day by the end of this financial year.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Madhuchanda Dey — Moneycontrol — Analyst,"And by ’25, what kind of capacity will be there for Rail Neer?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"By ’25, we would be — we have vetted all our plants, so we would be meeting the entire requirement. Nearly 80% of the railway’s requirement of the water will be met by all these measures that we are taking, then we will be serving nearly 18.5 lakh liter water in a day. So that will add a good amount of revenue to our stream.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Madhuchanda Dey — Moneycontrol — Analyst,"Got it, ma’am. And what about Catering, what are the future drivers? What can we look forward to?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"There is a future driver in the name of a new train fleet that is coming up, that is Vande Bharat, which is a prepaid train. We know that there has been an announcement that many more new rakes are going to be inducted. So that is going to add a fleet to our revenue, one. Secondly, the existing tenders which have not — could not be done yet because of — because we are small duration tender that we are trying to wind it up. And now we are focusing not only on the revenue side, on the operational side also so that we can provide better services to our customers and bring a good brand value to our businesses in addition to the revenue.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Madhuchanda Dey — Moneycontrol — Analyst,"So ma’am, my question is from these initiatives. One is Vande Bharat and the tending tenders, what kind of incremental revenue are you looking at for FY’24 to start with? And again, for FY’25, what kind of growth can we expect?",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"As and when the tenders are awarded, the revenue get settled, ma’am.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd

"Ajit Kumar — Director, Finance and Chief Financial Officer",Numbers have —,IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Madhuchanda Dey — Moneycontrol — Analyst,"Not numbers, but some idea about the kind of growth that —",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"It is an open bidding process, ma’am, at times vendors bid very high, then you get a good numbers. At times, when the train doesn’t — is not having a good route, then it gets a less bid, too difficult to project. At times, the competition in one sector is very high you get a very, very high bid. So — and then the other processes also there. So may be very difficult to predict. However, the growth will be there and a good amount of growth more than, I think, 10% is going to be — we can anticipate.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd 
Rajni Hasija — Chairman and Managing Director,"But once the segment which we should be — we are focusing with e-catering, where we have already reached to the extent of 40,000 meals in a day, and we are already providing. And in quarter four, the figure has been nearly 43,000 meals, and it is growing steadily. We have also started booking to our agents. These are B2C agents which are there on our website. And the number of our vendors with our food aggregator has also gone up. Number of food aggregators has also improved. The direct vendor number is also improving. So you can anticipate some growth in this segment as well.",IRCTC,Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd

Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to the Action Construction Equipment Limited Q4 FY ’23 Earnings Conference Call hosted by Monarch Networth Capital Limited. [Operator Instructions].",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,I now hand over the call to Ms. Vedika from Monarch Networth Capital Limited. Thank you and over to you ma’am.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vedika Singh — Monarch Networth Capital Limited — Analyst,"Good evening [Technical Issue], everyone. I would first to thank the management of Action Construction Equipment for giving Monarch Networth Capital the opportunity to host this call. We have with us the senior management of Action Construction, we have Mr. Sorab Agarwal, Executive Director; Mr. Rajan Luthra, CFO; and Mr. Vyom Agarwal, Senior Vice President.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vedika Singh — Monarch Networth Capital Limited — Analyst,"I will now hand it over to Sorab sir for giving the opening remarks, post which we will open the floor for Q&A. Over to you, sir.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome everybody to this earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter and year ended March ’23. Along with me in today’s earnings con-call. We have our CFO, Mr. Rajan Luthra; and our Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Vyom Agarwal. I hope all of you have had opportunity to look at the Company’s financial statements and the earnings presentation, which has been circulated and uploaded at the stock exchanges. This has been yet another year of strong and resonant performance by our Company and the results are a testimony to our clear and compelling strategy backed by the strength of our digital assets, our people and our plan. We not only navigated through the short-term challenges with agility, but also made progress on our long-term strategic values.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Let me take you through some of the highlights of this fiscal. We begin with, it gives me immense pleasure to report that we have crossed INR2,150 crores operation where we marked in this in this fiscal, and also recorded our highest-ever sales and profit in the quarter gone by. Our growth of 33% is significantly ahead of the market in our sector. Our EBITDA margin for the year expanded to 11.4% from 10% last year. And our EBITDA grew by 51.5% to INR247 crores on a standalone basis, as against INR163 crores in the preceding years. We were able to increase our PBT by 58.4% from INR138 crores in FY ’22 to INR220 crores in the last year. Similarly, our PAT also increased from INR106 crores to INR161 crores thereby, registering a growth of 52.2% in the last year.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"To briefly you on the financial performance of the fourth quarter of last year, the operational revenues stood at INR613 crores, which is up by 10.4% sequentially, and grew by 20% as compared to the same quarter, last year. Our Company was able to expand the EBITDA margin to 13.2%, PBT margin to 12%, and PAT margin to 8.5% in the last quarter. This was led by better product mix, improved price realizations, efficient cost-control measures and softening of the commodity phases. The EBITDA and PBT for the quarter stood at about INR81 crores, and INR73 crores, respectively. We continue to be a debt-free Company with sufficient availability of liquidity for growth. The Board of Directors has recommended a final dividend of 50%, that is INR1 per share for the year ended March ’23, the Board has also approved to grant ESOPs to the employee, but the ESOP program has been designed in a manner that employees are incentivized and their interests are aligned with those of the Company’s performance.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Now moving on to segmental business performance. We have strengthened our role as a market-leader in the Indian trade industry, and with us consistent efforts, we have scaled the business to over INR1,525 crores in this fiscal. Last year, our Crane business has registered a strong growth of 38.4%. The growth was both in value and volume terms, our number of claims has increased from INR5321 crores in FY ’22 to INR6584 crores in FY ’23. In Crane segment, we have been able to grow our profits by 53% to INR195 crores, with a margin expansion to 12.77% versus 11.5% for the year before that.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Our margins for quarter four stood at nearly 14%. Our Crane business is at its strongest in terms of size, aim, profitability and capability, and its impact on the nation’s development. Further, we are very pleased with the growth momentum in the CE segment, wherein we have surpassed our projected growth. The segment has clocked a yearly growth of 42% with a revenue of approximately INR250 crores, and increased margins at around 9.5% on a whole year basis, versus a 5.3%. And our margins for quarter four FY ’23 stood at 13.9% owing to the operating reasons.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Our Material Handling segment recorded revenue growth of 11.2% and stood at INR170 crores with margins at 12.33% as compared to 12% the year before. The Agri division also registered growth in revenue of around 7%, but the margins came under pressure owing to inflationary impact during the year. We have also expanded our global footprint and increased our export sales by 90% year-on year. The contribution of exports sales have increased to 6.7% as compared to 4.7% the year before. Further, we expect that going forward, the export segment will contribute about 9% to 10% of the overall volumes — overall revenues within this year, which is inline with our medium-term target of 15% to 20% contribution from exports. After two years of pandemic-led disruptions, FY ’23 marked a return to normalcy in operations. However, geopolitical tensions and continued supply-chain disruptions resulted in unprecedented inflation and volatility in commodity and energy prices.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Central banks across the world responded swiftly with sharp increase in interest rates within a relatively short timeframe. The Indian economy remains bright spot in FY ’23 amidst the global slowdown. Real GDP growth for the year is estimated at 7%. Against the backdrop of a challenging environment operating environment, as apostatised [Phonetic], the company’s customer-centricity, agility in seasoned market opportunities, focus on execution, and proactive strategic interventions enabled it to post strong numbers — strong performance across all operating segments. Our model is crafted in a manner that enables us on each business — it enabled us to focus on each business, while harnessing the diversity of our portfolio to create unique sources of competitive advantage. Our strategic positioning in the core sectors of infrastructure, manufacturing, logistics and agri will provide the necessary impetus to our growth trajectory.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Looking ahead, India is one of the fastest-growing economy and its prospects remain very strong for the period ahead. The infrastructure growth story continues to play a significant role in the economic growth, and will have its multiplier effect on the economy. We believe that going forward, the strong demand scenario should sustain itself, supported by government, and they been focused on urban, infra and rural development. The increased capital expenditure announced in the Union Budget 2023 will further aid this growth in FY ’24.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Going forward, in the current year, we expect a growth of at least 15% to 20% in our Crane, Metal Handling and Agri portfolios. For the Construction Equipment segment, we are looking at accelerated growth rates of 30% to 35% on an increased base. In terms of capacities, our Cranes and Metal Handling segments are reaching their peak utilization levels, and in order to fuel further growth, we are currently incurring a capital expenditure of INR80 crores to INR90 crores to enhance our capacity. The expansion will take shape from Q2 onwards and will enhance our installed capacity, and will have a potential to propel us to reach a turnover level of INR3,800 crores in the near future.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"On the whole, as a company, we are looking at a 15% to 20% growth in our top line for the current year, with further margin expansion of 150 basis-points. We hope we are in a position to revise the projections by end of second quarter, which will predominantly depend on the onset and intensity of the monsoons. Further, we remain optimistic about the medium-to-long term prospects of the company, and remain focused to deliver on our growth agenda. We will continue to drive cost savings harder and take calibrated pricing actions, whilst ensuring to protect and grow our markets. We believe that our building blocks are firmly in place and are on path of sustainable growth in all our segments where we operate leading to expansion in topline, bottom-line and the margin profile of the company.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,With this. I would like to open the call for question-and-answer session.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,Questions and Answers:,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from the line of Mr. Himanshu Upadhyay from o3 BMS. Go ahead.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — o3 Wealth and Asset Management — Analyst,Hello?,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Good afternoon, good evening.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — o3 Wealth and Asset Management — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. I just — I’ll just go ahead with my questions. The agriculture equipment has been on the downturn in terms of units for the last three years, the market was strong. Can you elaborate on what happened and the way forward here?.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"So we are talking about. I just missed the beginning, which segment?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — o3 Wealth and Asset Management — Analyst,Agricultural Equipment.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes. We have in a little roll down here as I did mention in the last all, last quarter. And Vyom, I think you’ll be able to clarify better here, with respect to what really happened in the last quarters.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vyom Agarwal — Senior Vice President,"Yes, hi. Good afternoon, Himanshu. And as you all know that the tractor industry has grown by around 10% and last fiscal, and we have been able to the additional growth of 6% in this space. When we talk about numbers, in Q4, our deliveries have been higher than our billings that goes to show that our inventory with our channel partners at the end of Q4 is lesser as compared to the previous quarters. Currently, our inventory levels with our channel partner is close to three to five weeks only. And one of the reasons that we have been reducing our inventories is the migration from BS-III norms to BS-IV norms, so post-July, the registration of the BS-III tractor inventory will not be permissible. So we have to reduce inventory at the channel level.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vyom Agarwal — Senior Vice President,"Owing to that, the volumes which you are seeing, has shown a little dip. However, going forward the crop prices, which is the MSV, the monsoon and the water reservoir levels remain at normal levels and we expect to experience a growth of around 10% to 15% in this segment of the current FY.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — o3 Wealth and Asset Management — Analyst,"Thank you. Thank you for that answer. I’ll go down to my second question. From the Material Handling, last time, we stated that we were having some issues and that was the reason on the growth in that segments, can we now assume that we are back on track and can do more than FY ’22 sales in numbers in this next year? Also how has been our market penetration in that segment and the share of the market?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yeah, market penetration has been very good. Our share is around 25%, 26%. And going forward, I think easily in the current year we are looking at a 15% to 20% growth here in numbers, if not more than that. Because we have overcome this plant as well as the supply-chain issues [Technical Issue] as the result of that, even in the last quarter. Even on a sequential basis, we were able to increase 15%. Going forward in this whole year, I think it should to do more than 15%, 20%.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — o3 Wealth and Asset Management — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Thank you. And my last question is that, how has the backhoe loaders done for us in FY ’23 versus FY ’22. And EBIT is now at 10% of the construction business, would we like to grow the share from hereon, or the margins will be the focus in the construction segment?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"I think, I also mentioned in our last con-call, on a quarterly result that as we start to go around INR250 crores and beyond that, our margins will start to — balancing similar to cranes. And if you look at the quarter four numbers of INR80 crore revenue, we have nearly touched 14% EBITDA margin here as well. So — and this is what I had mentioned earlier, that once we start to cross INR300 crores going towards INR350 crores on an annual basis, the margins would normalize to the crane levels, and we are already experiencing it. So hopefully, I think, in the current year, yes, we will grow our business at least 30%, 35%. It can only be faster than that, that time will tell. But the margin profile is, I think, here to stay now. It can only increase from here.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Himanshu Upadhyay — o3 Wealth and Asset Management — Analyst,"Thank you so much, sir. Thank you so much for all the answers. And that was my last questions. Thank you.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Harsh Saraswat [Phonetic] from Elegant Family Office. Over to you, sir.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Hi, Sorab. Congratulations on a great year. My first question would be, how does ACE prices in a comparable product compared to companies like JCB, Sansui and other MNC players? Is there a price differential which benefits us also other than having service centers across the country and all?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"See, it depends from product-to-product. I mean, backhoes is one category where obviously JCB is the market leader; there are seven, eight players. And cranes are there where we primarily compete with Escorts Kubota, and tower cranes with Potain. So here I would say that if we especially talk of backhoes, we are definitely better priced than JCB. And so, are the other players as well, leaving aside one or two like Caterpillar. All of them are positioned 8%, 10%, 12% lower than JCB, so we are also pretty similar there.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"With respect to cranes, we are more or less similar in most of the sales with respect to our competition. But yes, there are ups and downs depending on the customer profile or the size of the orders and also depends on our competition how much we are willing to play with respect to gaining the market, so we have to maintain that balance of market share as well.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Forklifts again, I would say that the main players are Godrej and Voltas and also Toyota to some extent. And Toyota is definitely slightly higher priced than all of us; and Voltas, Godrej and us; where we are nearly similar bracketed with respect to price as of now. So a little off, a little here and there depending on models, depending on customers.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,Got it. Got it. Got it. And another question was how does import work in this segment? Like can you import a whole crane or it is broken up and assembled here in India? And what are the import duties on this?,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"See, if I talk of backhoe loaders, India is perhaps, I think, the world’s largest producer of backhoe loaders, so there are practically no imports.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,Okay.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"And something even with respect to road machinery, very few units here and there, sizes and things which are not made in India might be getting imported. But most of the global players are also present in India. And India is producing its own road machinery, as high as [Phonetic] that are competitors. If I talk of pick-and-carry cranes, we are the world’s largest producer of pick-and-carry cranes, so we only export some of them from India. And going forward, those numbers are only going to increase, so there is nothing to worry about with respect to imports. But when I talk of cranes as a whole, see, pick-and-carry is the biggest strong player. But then again, tower cranes are there where we are market leaders. And where we do get some Chinese imports, mainly due [Phonetic] to European, I would say, especially in a very high tonnage or a very sensitive type of model, which is not made in India.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"For crawler cranes and truck cranes, which is a growing — which has been a growing segment within the crane segments in the last, I would say, 10 years, eight years, but especially in the last four or five years, yes, there a lot of imports happen from the Chinese. And to be frank, had ridiculous prices and ridiculous payment terms. So the capex we are doing is currently to enhance our capacity in these crawler cranes and truck cranes, which is the higher tonnage cranes. The quantities comparatively are much lower as compared to pick-and-carry cranes. But yes, India is moving towards high tonnage cranes because so much construction, elevated construction is happening, all the metros and the bullet trains and the flyovers. So, yes, we need bigger cranes. And we are increasing our capacity there. So yes, but the bigger cranes, currently, yes, the imports are dominating. But the numbers are miniscule as compared to pick-and-carry cranes.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Got it. Got it. So also on the export side, when you say that we will take our revenue to 10% of the total revenue of export revenues, how do we compete against these Chinese players in the international markets like on the prices and all? What do we tell the customers that we are giving more that they buy from us?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"See, like I mentioned, the Chinese players are dominant only in the crawler cranes and the truck crane segment, which even we are evolving in the country as of now. So we are rather focusing on our strength, let’s say, pick-and-carry cranes. We are the largest producer in the world, and India is the largest pick-and-carry producing country. India is one of the largest backhoe producing countries in the world. And especially products like backhoe has, the product is well-established in more or less all the countries. So we are focusing more on products with our company or our country as a strength with respect to the product.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"As of now, we are not at all trying to compete in the crawler crane or the truck crane segments because here the market size is smaller. The ticket size is big, but the market size is small. And we still have to create our strength there. I mean, we have strength, we want to increase those strengths in the country to be able to compete effectively with the Chinese. So like I said, we are focusing on backhoes. We are focusing on pick-and-carry cranes. We are focusing on some higher horsepower tractors, 80-90 horsepower tractors with respect to exports, where India is really good at.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Got it. Makes sense, makes sense. All the best for the future, Sorab. Thanks.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,Thank you.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Devesh Kasliwal from Antique Stock Broking. Over to you, sir.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Devesh Kasliwal — Antique Stock Broking Limited — Analyst,Hello?,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yeah, hi.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Devesh Kasliwal — Antique Stock Broking Limited — Analyst,"Yeah. Congratulations on a good set of numbers. I just wanted to understand the overall market size, the addressable market share that we have in the crane segment as well as in the forklift segment. And how has it grown over the past two years? And what are we expecting the industry growth to be in the coming two to three years, given by the overall industrial activities that are going on? What is the expected growth rate in the industry as such?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"If you look at cranes, pick-and-carry cranes, because in our cranes segment we report numbers for our pick-and-carry cranes, tower cranes and also crawler cranes, truck [Phonetic] cranes. But there also that crane segment has been — pick-and-carry segment has been growing at a good rate about 20%, 25%.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Tower cranes even faster than that, about, I would say, maybe 35%, 40%. And something similar for the bigger cranes where obviously we are building our capacities now to bring Indian products into the market. And going forward, I think, there might be similar momentum should sustain looking at the overall scenario, if not faster. And even the construction equipment overall market size in the country has gone up by about 25% approximately in the last year, which gels very well with — because we are also focusing now on construction equipment to bring in additional growth. And we feel that it might be the fastest-growing segment for us for a good amount of time now, going forward.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Material handling has been little, I do not know why, growing only at about 10%, 20%. I believe that would have been faster. But I’m sure with the mechanization and manufacturing growing in our country, it will catch up very fast.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Devesh Kasliwal — Antique Stock Broking Limited — Analyst,"So, is it right to assume that the entire cranes market that is there, so it will be ballpark figure around INR2,500 crores, INR3,000 crores? And forklift, it’s between INR700 crores, INR800 crores as of now?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes. The entire crane market may be close to about INR3,000 crores or say less than that, I would say. Maybe around INR2,500, INR2,600, INR2,700. And forklift maybe at about I would say about 7,000-odd units because the models again range. So the pricing goes plus and minus — plus, minus than that. But I would say maybe about INR600 crores, INR700 crores.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Devesh Kasliwal — Antique Stock Broking Limited — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, one last question. We had actually rolled out some products in the crane segment. So the traditional products that we had, we had rolled out in segments — like a man list attached to a pick-and-carry crane and products like that, two to three products. So what is the overall traction on that side? Are we — like what is the overall demand? As well as how much of that — if at all you have those numbers, how much of that is contributing to the cranes revenue right now?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes. I think about three years back, just around COVID, we had brought in these multi-activity cranes NX series. And yes, some time was wasted during COVID, one or two years because people were not willing to spend money and there was, in any case, hyperinflation happening all around. But yes, in saying that, in the last year, we have seen really good traction there. And to be very frank with you, although the numbers there are small maybe it’s all about 3%, 4% of the entire pick-and-carry cranes that we are doing as of now. But they’ve already started contributing to our bottom line, and you can also see increase in our bottom line here and there. So this is primarily due to this changing product mix and obviously some realization.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"And going forward, already the type of traction and order booking which is happening for these NX, the new type of cranes, this is very encouraging. And I think, in the next two years, three years, they can really become 10%, 20% of our portfolio of pick-and-carry cranes. And there the margin profile is really good because of the innovation part.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Devesh Kasliwal — Antique Stock Broking Limited — Analyst,"Okay. Thanks a lot, sir. Congratulations again on the good set of number. Thank you.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,Thank you.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ms. Jyoti Singh from Arihant Capital Markets Ltd. Over to you.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Jyoti Singh — Arihant Capital Markets Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you for the opportunity. And sir, congratulations on the great set of numbers. So, my question is on the — yeah, like you have guided 15% to 20% growth in Crane and Agri. So — also you guided to 20% to 25% that I missed, for which part? And second question, I wanted to know your view overall industry, how is it going? And what’s our expectation, going forward?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes. See, we have projected 15% to 20% growth for cranes for Material Handling and for Agri. And 30%, 35% growth for Construction Equipment, the CE segment. And I think the overall industry is also growing, but we have been lucky enough to grow faster than the industry. And see, especially in Cranes, we were able to grow 38%, Construction Equipment 41% and against the industry growth of around 20%, 25%. So that is the advantage we’ve been able to gain even in the last year. And we hope we continue to gain that advantage because that’s how our market share will keep on increasing.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,What was the second part of your question?,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Jyoti Singh — Arihant Capital Markets Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah. So and sir, there on the margin side, like we are targeting, it will expand 100, 150 bps. So what are your strategy to lead this EBITDA margin expansion?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Basically, it is to be very frank with you we purely coming in from operating leverage. And as a matter of fact, it can be more than that. Pricing is sensitive, if you have to maintain market share. So it is a mix of operating leverage coupled with wherever possible, if we can increase our prices, coupled with the changing product mix because, yes, within the pick-and-carry range, again, there is a shift towards slightly higher tonnage where realizations get better.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Jyoti Singh — Arihant Capital Markets Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay. Great. Thank you, sir.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,Yeah. Thank you.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Rajiv Maheshwari [Phonetic] from Praj Investments [Phonetic]. Over to you.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,Hi. Good evening.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yeah, good evening.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"I had a couple of questions. Like in terms of we were planning some acquisitions, as we discussed in the last couple of con-calls. So what is the current state on that? And if you can throw some light in terms of the utilization of the QIP amount?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yeah. I think QIP amount utilization, Mr. Luthra will take that question. And regarding acquisitions, do Vyom, you want to elaborate?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vyom Agarwal — Senior Vice President,"Yeah. Good afternoon, Rajiv. And as we had indicated earlier that there were a couple of exciting opportunities for us, one in the backward-integration space and one in the forward-integration space. Coming to the backward-integration, there was a company which had gone to NCLT. It was an SME company where we were trying to bid for the company. However, unfortunately, the bankers and the COC have decided to grant that in favor of the existing promoters being an MSME, so that thing for the time being, it has been kept on abeyance.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vyom Agarwal — Senior Vice President,"For the forward-linkage part, there was an acquisition which we were targeting. But seeing how this space, especially the Cranes and the Construction Equipment space is behaving, the valuations currently are not logical enough to go ahead with that acquisition as of now. Although we still are trying on that to keep the valuations at a logical level, and if in case something happens in this phase, we will keep everyone informed.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Apart from these two, there is nothing new in the pipeline which has come up, I believe?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vyom Agarwal — Senior Vice President,"No, there are three, four other opportunities which we are working upon quite aggressively. But these were the two on the very advanced stages, which we had discussed in our earlier con calls as well.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,Okay.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vyom Agarwal — Senior Vice President,"Apart from these two, there are three, four other opportunities in some related space, which we are working on.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Vyom, but I think his question was very specific on something, which I think I have been able to figure out. No, nothing as of now, but we are expecting something.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay. Yes, to put it straight. And with regards to the utilization of the QIP amount?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes. As regard the QIP proceeds is about INR135 crores which was is lying as such as — just for us for the — whenever we acquire this company. And if you have noticed that our investment has grown up to INR400 crore. Not only the QIP proceeds, but as well as the, whatever the profit we are generating and has been conservatively used and has been put into the liquid investment for — as and when the time opportunity comes, we are able to encash them and still remain a debt-free company after acquiring any of the companies which we have.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"As a matter of fact, we are also saving up this money for the opportunity maybe you were talking about.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. That’s good. The amount has gone up, so maybe it’s for maybe something good may come up, it’s good to know that. One thing I noticed that in the quarterly results, there is a difference in the other income mentioned in the stand-alone as well as in the consolidated. So what’s the reason for that? I think it’s — the difference is close to INR4 crores.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"Yeah, actually that difference is basically because of the — in the earlier, in June quarter, something that money has moved from the — wrongly stated as reserves, which has moved to the — from — reduced from income and gone into translation result because that was because of the change in currency value.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"No, no. But why is it then not that part not shown in the consolidated profit and loss account?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"It is already mentioned, I will — if you can give me your e-mail, I will probably explain there much better. Okay.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"I’ll share my email ID. And one quick question. How is the electric crane going on in terms of the — any commercial production, the orders? And how have things gone?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"We were waiting three, four months to commercialize it. So hopefully in the next quarter we will commercialize it. The excitement is very much there. We want to be very sure once we release the product in the market. We had launched it, showcased it. And currently the endurance testing and all the cycles are being done up. And obviously the facility is being geared up to be able to produce and we are also on the capex because we are totally consumed in our capacities with our existing products.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,Okay.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"So I think in Q2, we should be able to commercialize it.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"So still maybe three, four months down the line?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes, yes.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay, then. Thanks a lot.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,Thank you.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from Ms. Vedika Singh from Monarch Networth Capital Limited.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vedika Singh — Monarch Networth Capital Limited — Analyst,Hello sir.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yeah. Hi, Vedika.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vedika Singh — Monarch Networth Capital Limited — Analyst,"Sir, what is the likely traction in the CE space that we are seeing? And what is our target revenue mix for the business in FY ’25 or ’26?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"I think, we should easily be able to grow this business at 30%, 35% every year to be a little conservative. And I’m saying that, so I think we should definitely be looking at INR325 crores, INR350 crores or maybe a little more than that in the current fiscal. And I’m going at a 30%, 35% increase ratio, so I think, we should be hitting INR500 crores in the next 1.5 to two years.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vedika Singh — Monarch Networth Capital Limited — Analyst,"Okay, sir. And what would be the overall revenue mix coming from the MHC cranes? Would there be a deviation from our current product mix in two years down the line?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Which cranes are we talking about, Vedika?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vedika Singh — Monarch Networth Capital Limited — Analyst,"Sir, the overall revenue mix coming from Construction Equipment cranes. Since we are so bullish on the Construction Equipment, would the revenue mix change?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yeah, maybe a little bit in favor of Construction Equipment at the cost of especially, I would say, Metal Handling and Agri because they’ll be growing slower. Yes, the crane, the base itself is big. So it might be a small — very small one or 2%, 3% there. But I think over the next two, three years, construction equipment currently is our second biggest segment already at 11%. So that should definitely start to look something like maybe at about, let’s say, next two, three years of INR4,000 crore revenue, INR5,000 crore revenue and this being maybe about 12%, 13%, 14%, something like that.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vedika Singh — Monarch Networth Capital Limited — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Okay. Sir, could you also share the progress on the Ghana plant, what’s happening and what’s the time line that we are following at present?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yeah. Unfortunately, we were looking at — to start execution in quarter one. But due to — Luthra Sir, would you want to answer that? You are more abreast with the Ghana news.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"Yeah. Basically, there has been some discussions going on between the Ghana government and the Indian government and which — because it was — the project was funded by the Indian government through Exim Bank of India, and we were — and we would have — although payments were secured from the Exim Bank including advanced payment and all those things, there have been some regulatory issue between Ghana government and the Indian government which is, I understand, is under discussions. So once that is — which we expect to be resolved very soon.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"Once we resolve them, once the Indian government gives clearance, then the Exim Bank will start making payments to us. Once we — and we will start the project only when we get the advanced payments because we don’t want to take risk on the government asset, but we only because of the secured payment we do the business. So hopefully the situation should — I mean, whatever, should be resolved in the next one or two months. And we are looking at our payments going through the Exim Bank most probably in the coming quarters. So we are hopeful that — I mean, we were expecting quarter one to start execution. So hopefully quarter two, we should be in a position to start execution at some time.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vedika Singh — Monarch Networth Capital Limited — Analyst,"Still, sir, for now we have not put in any capital towards Ghana, right, from our end?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Not really capital, but a lot of intellectual capital, I would say, because all the planning and with respect to the plant that is going to be set up there and with respect to the proposed ordering for that, most of the homework has been done by us, finished by us.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"Yes. But we have not spent any financial commitment as such to vendors and everything, so.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,We have not deployed any capital assets.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,Yeah.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vedika Singh — Monarch Networth Capital Limited — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Thank you so much, sir.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,Yes.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Suhrid Deorah from Paladin Capital. Over to you.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Suhrid Deorah — Paladin Capital Management LLP — Analyst,"Yeah. Hi, sir. Just one quick question, accounting question. Could you explain what is impairment losses of financial assets?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Impairment losses of financial assets, Luthra Sir?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"Yeah, see, basically this is the — making a provision for the expected credit loss because recently the accounting standard has been revised from last one or two years and which has made a stringent — we have made a stringent policy of making provisions for overdues which are more than six months or so. So depending on those policies and because on the historical trend and all those things, we have made a expected credit loss. This may not happen, but we have made a provision. So that isn’t shown separately as a impairment of the receivables basically.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"To be very frank, in short, DSR, where KPMG has become our audit firm now and so they wanted to make the provisioning very transparent and very clear. So although most of these payments are recoverable, but they have a provision for it under this.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Suhrid Deorah — Paladin Capital Management LLP — Analyst,"Okay. So is it fair to assume that the receivables that are shown in the books, the rest of them are likely to materialize over the next 12 months and you won’t see such a large write-off, going forward?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes, anything possible, DSR has made sure it is provisioned. But in saying that, most of the provisioning is actually recoverable, to be very frank with you. And whatever receivables which are balance are 100% recoverable.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Suhrid Deorah — Paladin Capital Management LLP — Analyst,Okay. Got it. So this is a one-time thing?,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"It got delayed a little beyond six months or whatever as Mr. Luthra sir was saying, and they have been provided for.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Suhrid Deorah — Paladin Capital Management LLP — Analyst,Got it. Thank you. Got it.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Mr. Jitendra Pethkar from JD Capital [Phonetic], over to you. Mr. Pethkar, please go ahead with your question sir.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"I think, we can skip and got to the next one.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,"Our next question is from Indumathi Rangan [Phonetic], an individual investor.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Hi. I have a few questions. My question is — my first question is, in the last conference call you said that the Chinese are selling large cranes in India at very low prices and giving one year credit to buyers, but we are entering the large crane segment by building a new plant for it. So how are you going to compete with the Chinese players who are selling at such low prices and also offering one year’s credit?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"In all probability, by doing the same thing. By offering competitive prices and wherever possible credit terms, obviously secured credit terms to LC and all. First I’ll start with the credit terms. We have tied up with some banks at very good interest rates with respect to sale bill discounting and healthy discounting, wherein I think we should be able to compete with the Chinese on the credit terms. And I’m sure as soon as there is an alternative available, the customers will start to prefer Indian buyers.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes, with respect to bigger cranes, their prices are really ridiculous with respect to margin profile. We would have thought that bigger cranes should not be less than 20%, 25% EBITDA levels. But still they are not that bad once we produce them in good quantity in India. Our only — I think in the last four, five years, what was holding us back was the possible margin profile. But once we calculated that after increasing our business by around five times and competing at same prices. So because of the operating leverage part of it, which will come. I think, last year we did the bigger cranes — just pulling out a paper, just a second — close to about INR130 crores, INR140 crores approximately. And obviously once we are doing INR400 crores, INR500 crores and operating leverage that will come along with it, I’m sure will help us compete with the Chinese.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"And my second question is, the Chinese products are now being imported, but you will be manufacturing the large cranes in India itself. So that will give you a logistic cost advantage, correct? Is that logistics cost advantage going to be an important part of your competitive advantage? And what percentage of competitive advantage will you have because of the logistic cost?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"The logistics will give us anywhere between 7% to 8% advantage. But apart from logistics, another part is the Chinese machines which are being imported they also attract a 7.5% custom duty, so that barrier is also there. But even after calculating all of that, they are still being very competitive. And in a way, you can say some sort of dumping. So we are also — we’ve been in talks with MHI and DGFT with regards to these ill practices of the Chinese companies. And they are also planning, and if something like that happens, then it can be much more beneficial in our favor.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Our [Technical Issue] from PhillipCapital, PCG.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Yes, sir. Good afternoon, team. Congratulations for the really good job. Sir, two things, I just make a clarification on like when we are guiding for crane segment to grow at maybe 15% to 20%. So are we considering the incremental revenue from crawler crane or it is not factored in this guidance?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"As of now, no, to be very frank with you, because the plant will become operational next quarter. And obviously we will have some incremental revenue with respect to crawler cranes and truck cranes. I’m sure the numbers will double up at least in the second half. Yes, so it could be additional INR30 crores, INR40 crores, INR50 crores, which might trickle in, but we have not factored that in, and.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Speaker —,"Probably, that could come in Q3 or Q4, right?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes, Q3, Q4. And to answer your question very frankly, we have pegged it at 15%, 20%, the Crane segment, but I think it is going to be bigger than that.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Fantastic. And sir, another thing on Agri side. So like as we have reached the optimum revenue for Construction Equipment, which is reflected in your margins as well, which is similar to your Crane segment. So for Agri what could be that option revenue side revenue where we can see some margin improvement because that is the one of the segment where we are not able to show the margin improvement. So any thought on that one?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,And it is also our pain point.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Exactly. So like once the margin improvement is visible in that segment, then probably you would be — you would have all four product buckets, which is roughly 10% to 12% kind of EBIT margin. So that’s why need some — your thoughts on",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"When Agri starts to perform, believe me, we will start doing more than 15% — 14%, 15%. But in saying that, I think they’re similar to backhoe loaders, I mean this Construction Equipment. As soon as we start doing a INR70 crores, INR75 crores, I would say INR75 crores at least on a quarterly basis, let’s say, INR300 crores on an annual basis, which I think is really not possible in this coming year, but definitely in the year after that. Our margin profile can be similar to other segments like Cranes and Construction Equipment.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"And similar questions, we was being asked two years back regarding our Construction Equipment, and we’ve been able to solve that and bring it to normalcy. So hopefully, I mean, not in the next one year, definitely you’ll see improvement in the Agri. But I think FY ’25, if you are able to do a INR300 crores, INR350 crores turnover, I think the margin profile will start to look very different.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Got it, sir. Thank you very much and all the best.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,Thank you.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Jitendra Pethkar [Phonetic] from JD Capital [Phonetic]. Over to you.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,Can you all hear me?,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yeah, yeah. We can hear you, yes.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay. Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. One is about Note 11 in the annual result, which mentioned some corrections that have been made for the previous year’s consolidated results. Is it because of changing in the accounting practices? What is it? Is there any impact, financial impact on that?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Mr. Luthra, financial impact [Phonetic]?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"Yeah, actually, there is no financial impact. There are certain regrouping only from one head to another head. So these are basically all balance sheet items only where some loans have moved to advances and all those. These are small corrections, you can say, as per EBIT, because with the change in auditors different view has been taken on that it should be shown as security deposit or rather than advances and — so this is — if you have noticed that there has been no change in the financial profit and loss in the — no restatement on the profit and loss for the previous year.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"Yes, definitely, balance sheet has been restated, but very minutely in certain heads, moving from one head to another in the similar category. Some assets from, financial assets have gone to other assets and like that all, so.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,[Technical Issue].,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"No significant impact on the net worth, on [indecipherable], not facing any impact on that, no impact on the net worth and the book value of the share.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,And my second question is about defense as a new sector. Is there any possibility of business growing rapidly there in that sector?,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes, there are definitely possibilities. I think 2.5% to 3% revenue contribution has come from defense in the current year. And internally, we have targeted 8% to 10% revenue going forward as soon as possible to come in from defense sector.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"So hopefully, I think, this year would be better than last year with respect to defense business. And we are working on different projects, different requirements. The gestation is slightly longer, sometimes they click quickly sometimes — but generally will take longer. So that’s where we stand. Internally we plan to take revenue contribution from defense to 8% to 10%. Eventually, currently we are working at about approximately 2.5%.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"So going forward, we hope to get more traction and a little better margins in the defense?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes. I mean, good margins. Margins are reasonable generally in the defense business, because the products and the requirements are pretty typical and sort of tailor-made. So I think they will be in sync with the profile of the segment we are working in.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,Fine. Thank you and congratulations for good numbers. And I hope the impact of this Note 11 is not more than about INR4 crores as it can be generally seen broadly as I can see.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes, I think, again, because of the new auditors. So wherever, you understand very well, wherever they thought maybe some grouping or whatever Mr. Luthra was explaining. But there is really no financial impact, right, Mr. Luthra?",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"Yes, there is no. As I stated, there has been no impact on the profit/loss of the last year also. And the only restatement was basically in taking some investment as current or to mostly non-current. And only this movement has been from one head to another head.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Unidentified Participant —  — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Thank you very much.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Rajan Luthra — Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary,"And no, there will be no future adjustment because now we have aligned the number as per the KPMG requirements.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. As there are no further questions, I would like to hand the conference over to the management for closing comments.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Yes. Thank you. Even about 2-2.5 years back we planned and conceived that by FY ’24 we will double our turnover from about INR1,100 crores, INR1,200 crores and take the company to about INR2,500 crores. So as of now, we seem to be on track to take our company beyond INR2,500 crores in the current financial year. And going forward, I think this would again be our endeavor, to double ourselves in the forthcoming three years. And as conveyed, we are looking at 15% to 20% growth on the conservative side in the current year, which will be driven by Cranes, Metal Handling and Agri with about a 15%, 20% contribution and Construction Equipment at a slightly better pace.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"And more importantly, I think double-digit margins for us are here to stay. And within the coming quarters and this year, I’m sure we’ll be able to further increase our margin profile by at least 100 to 150 basis points, if not more. And the scenario in the country seems to be good and buoyant. Slight dependency on the monsoons, I would say, because that does impact the buying pattern a little. But on the whole, things seem to be on the right track. And we seem to be heading in the right direction as per our plan. Yes.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Sorab Agarwal — Executive Director,"Thank you, everybody, and good evening.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vyom Agarwal — Senior Vice President,"Thank you, everybody.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Operator,"Thank you, I will now hand over the conference to Ms. Vedika Singh from Monarch Networth Capital Limited. Over to you, ma’am.",ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited 
Vedika Singh — Monarch Networth Capital Limited — Analyst,Thanks to the management for taking us through the FY ’23 results and a promising future outlook. Thanks to all the participants for joining us today. We would now like to close the call.,ACE,Action Construction Equipment Limited

Operator,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question is from the line of Nalin Shah from NVS Brokerage. Please, go ahead.",NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Nalin Shah — NVS Brokerage — Analyst,"Very good afternoon to everybody. I have two questions, sir, overall broad questions, that in spite of having a turnover, I mean, total, I would say, the revenue at something like almost INR8,000 crores, INR9,000 crores, why these last three years have been seeing that our PAT level margin is hardly about 3%, whereas all the last about two, two-and-half years, all the real estate companies are doing extremely well, even if you see your return on net worth, it is hardly anything which we have earning. So, what is the reason for such a pathetic, I think, performance?",NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
P.K. Gupta — Chairman-Cum-Managing Director,Our PAT is 7.25%. PBT margin is 7.25%.,NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Nalin Shah — NVS Brokerage — Analyst,"PBT margin, I’m seeing the 2023, our PAT is at INR238 crores. Am I right? On a top-line of INR7,884 crores, this is hardly 3%. Again, in the previous year also, I see it is 3% even on that one.",NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Unidentified Speaker —,"I mean, last year, actually in these two years, we have to book some exceptional items due to which…",NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Nalin Shah — NVS Brokerage — Analyst,Like?,NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Unidentified Speaker —,"…the PAT has been remains at the same level. Otherwise, if you will see our EBITDA margins, we see drastic change in our EBITDA margin from 2.82% to now we have achieved the 4.47%.",NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Nalin Shah — NVS Brokerage — Analyst,"Correct. But I think in the overall context of the volumes, there is hardly any profitability.",NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Unidentified Speaker —,The PAT has [Speech Overlap],NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Nalin Shah — NVS Brokerage — Analyst,"Like if I see 3% margins, which you see, in many projects, in Mumbai, I’m talking of Mumbai because I’m more conversant with Mumbai, I mean, the real estate companies pay even 2% and 3% brokerages to the brokers, whereas we are earning hardly about 3%. What is the, I think, reason for such a poor profitability? It is because of the, I think, the tender system in which we are growing at very, very cheap rate we are quoting? That is the reason, or what is the reason?",NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Unidentified Speaker —,NBCC total revenue is from the project management consultancy work.,NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Nalin Shah — NVS Brokerage — Analyst,Correct.,NBCC,NBCC India Ltd

Nalin Shah — NVS Brokerage — Analyst,Correct.,NBCC,NBCC India Ltd 
Unidentified Speaker —,"Our real estate portion is hardly 2% to 3%, and rest is EPC. So, if you are comparing our turnover with the other developers in the Mumbai that is not the case, but definitely, our real estate projects have contributed this time a huge margin. Against the sale of INR195 crores, there is a gross margin of INR68 crores in the real estate projects. But that constitute a very small portion of our total revenue.",NBCC,NBCC India Ltd

It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the quarter-ending March 2023 Earnings Conference Call of Panama Petrochem Limited. Results for March quarter has been more or less on expected lines. On revenue front, there was a good demand in domestic market with healthy realizations. In spite of the prevailing geopolitical challenges, logistical issues and the crude price uncertainty, the Company reported stable earnings for the quarter ended 31st March 2023. There has been good offtake of value-added products like textile oils, white oils and other industrial needs, which enabled us to maintain EBITDA margin around 14%.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"The forex market has been very volatile during the entire year, due to which there has been significant increase in the cost of finance due to the dramatic increase in the rate of interest on global front.

Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Further, the company has repaid all the short-term debt and has become a debt-free company in true sense. The company has announced a final dividend of INR5 in addition to the interim dividend of INR3 per share, totalling to INR8 per share, equal to 400%, that’s a bearing to the dividend payout policy of the company.

Operator,Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Sujit Chaudhary as an Individual Investor. Please go ahead.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Sujit Chaudhary — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Hello. Good morning, sir. I am Sujit Chaudhary. Sir, one question is, are there any challenges in raw-material oil procurement.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Thank you for your question. There has been supply-chain concerns in the markets. Our refinery suppliers have been on maintenance turnaround in the last few months. However, the company has firm long-term contracts, supply contracts, which ensures smooth procurement. Also these firm contracts enabled the company to maintain optimum inventory levels, which helps to mitigate and absorb any fluctuations in the oil prices.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Sujit Chaudhary — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Thank you, sir.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Akash Gupta as an Individual investor. Please go ahead.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Akash Gupta — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Yeah, hello, very good morning. Yeah, sir, I would like to know the contribution of value-added products in this quarter? Then, has the margin in this segment impacted?",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Thank you, Akash, for your questions. The company intentionally added value added products over conventional products in the product mix. The product mix has improved in favor of value-add products to the tune of 68%, thereby enabling the company to report healthy EBITDA margins of 13.4% in this quarter vis-a-vis 12.04% in the preceding quarter. So, we have been successfully implementing our strategy to improve the product mix in favor of value adds. Thank you.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Naresh N. as an Individual Investor. Please go ahead.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Naresh N. — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Good morning, sir.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd.

Naresh N. — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Could you please guide us on revenues and operating margins in coming quarters, and how you see years forward from here. And we will be able to sustain the margins going forward?",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Thank you, Naresh, for your question. We anticipate more stability and normalcy in the years coming ahead in the business environment, thereby giving more visibility on the business front. We expect the Indian markets to outperform in comparison to the global markets, and we expect robust demand for our products. We anticipate a good demand in our product, especially for our textile oils, white oils and other industrial lubricants. Due to these favorable factors, we expect to sustain the margins, and we are hopeful for a 15% growth in the revenues and sustainable margins. Thank you.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Naresh N. — Individual Investor — Analyst,Thank you very much.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,The next question is from the line of Sudhir Bheda from Right Time Consultancy. Please go ahead.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Sudhir Bheda — Right Time Consultancy — Analyst,"Yes, good morning, sir. See, the result is very disappointed from the shareholder point-of-view, as we believe that whatever reasons you mentioned, geopolitical reason, well, in the December quarter [Technical Issues], but in the March quarter, there was quite a stability in the investment. So, even we are not able to hold on to the per kg or per tonne margins, and we are even de-growing — de-grew our revenue from INR572 crores in December to INR510 crores. If course, the oil prices have come down, but then we are not able to maintain the per ton margin in the March quarter compared to the December quarter, and to year-over-year, the performance is even worse, as PBT has declined from INR68 crores to INR62 crores. So how do we see the year forward? Are we now getting into the revenue growth in the coming year and able to hold on to our margin of say 14%. So how is the scenario looks like in year ahead. Thank you very much.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, thank you for your question, Mr. Sudhir. First of all, I would like to inform you that the company — the focus of the company is more on the value-added products. As I also mentioned in one of the previous answers that I just gave, that we have intentionally conceding our exposure to the conventional grades and using it with more value-added products, which can get healthy realizations and better margins. If you could see in the quarter four March ’23, the EBITDA margins have increased to 13.4% compared to 12.04% in the preceding quarter. The volumes in this quarter were maintained. The revenues were down as you rightly said, the oil prices has been downwards, thereby, there has been decrease in the price, but the margins are sustained in this quarter. If you see on a whole yearly basis for the year ended March ’22, ’23, the company has done total on a consol basis a total of PAT of INR233 crores, which is higher than the last year, and the total revenues of the company for the year stood at INR2,255 crores compared to INR2138 crores in the preceding year. So overall, as I said, the management is more focused on the margins to be sustained, and that can be achieved with the introduction of more product mix in favor of the value-add products.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Sudhir Bheda — Right Time Consultancy — Analyst,"How do you see, because now oil prices are more or less stable between $70 and $80, and now, as you say, there is no volume growth compared to the December quarter. So how do you see the volume growing in the current fiscal FY ’24. And whether — I’m talking about the per tonne margin, whether we are able to hold on to per tonne margin.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"We have been given a guidance on the EBITDA margin, and we are sustaining those EBITDA margins. We are hopeful that in the coming year, we will be able to increase our revenues by 15% further, and all our expansion plans are as per the plan, I mean, going ahead as per the plan.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,"Thank you. Mr. Bheda, request you to join the queue for any follow up. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manpreet Singh as an Individual Investor. Please go ahead.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Manpreet Singh — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Rayani. Mr. Rayani, my question is that in the previous question, you were just asked that how the quarter-on-quarter revenue de-grew, and you mentioned that because the focus was more on specialty products, so okay. Now, on an overall basis, if you look at financial year, definitely you were able to grow your consolidated revenues by let’s say 5% and capture earning per share stable, but what I’m seeing is that this actually happened in the first half. So, your first half of FY ’23 was much better than your second half of FY ’23, whereas in first half FY ’23, I feel the global economic scenario was more difficult because the war had just started, the commodity prices were shooting all over the place, the supply-chain concern, there were some problems in Egypt also, and then Suez Canal that ship had got stuck. So, I think second-half actually things got smoothened out and got better, but still your revenues were lower in your second-half versus first half. So, what are your thoughts around it? And second part of the question is that, is it because it’s coming from particular sector that you serve. Because I do understand your revenue mix, you’ve got pharma, you are serving around 20%, 25%, then you’ve got other sectors. So has it been that any particular sector has been weak in the second-half, which resulted in all this?",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, thank you for your question, Mandeep. There has been a volatile situation throughout the years we had experienced. As you see, the oil prices have been quite volatile all through the year. Also, there were harsh increases in the global interest rates which resulted in high cost of finance. Just to give you a comparison, this year we had finance cost of about INR10 crores compared to INR4 crores in the last year. So there has been a lot of volatile conditions. The currency was fluctuating. This year we had, for this year ’22, ’23, we had a notional exchange loss of around INR12 crores. Despite these conditions, we have maintained EBITDA margins for the whole year about 14% compared to the last year on similar levels. So, as I said, the focus — we have seen the volatility still persist throughout the year, but as I had mentioned earlier, the focus of the management is to focus on more value-added products which are bearing better margins. So that would be the way forward going ahead.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Manpreet Singh — Individual Investor — Analyst,"I understand, and I hope that you are able to come out of this, so really wish you the best of luck for it.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Thank you so much, Mandeep, for your wishes.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rohan Mehta as an Individual Investor. Please go ahead.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Rohan Mehta — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Okay, good morning, sir. First of all, congratulations for good set of numbers. Sir, a small clarification is required on the finance cost, when it is compared with the same quarter last year, it has increased by around INR1 crore. So, are we having any expansion plans or why it has increased basically?",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,The finance cost increases due to the increase in the interest rates on the global front.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Rohan Mehta — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Okay, sir. These are the floating loans basically.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,Yes.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Rohan Mehta — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Nilesh Chawla from Shaw and Chawla LLP. Please go ahead.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Nilesh Chawla — Shaw and Chawla LLP — Analyst,"Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Mr. Hussein, can you please share volume data for Q3 and Q4.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, so on the consol basis, the Q3 volume was about 59,000 tons. And in the Q4, it was about 57,000 tons.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Nilesh Chawla — Shaw and Chawla LLP — Analyst,"In fact, we were thinking of increasing volume by about 15%, rather than we have de-grown our volume.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, as I said, we are intentionally concising our exposure on the conventional grade of oils. And of course, it is being replaced by more value-added products. The volume is not vis-a-vis the same, but overall, it has a good impact on the EBITDA margins, which is shown in this quarter.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Nilesh Chawla — Shaw and Chawla LLP — Analyst,"So, per tonne margin, can you please share with us. What is our per tonne margin for both these quarters.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"On EBITDA percentage, it’s about 13.44% in this quarter compared to 12% in the last one.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Nilesh Chawla — Shaw and Chawla LLP — Analyst,"Generally, I think we have always talked about margin on tonne basis, rather than EBITDA because you say the volume, I mean the rate may — the oil price may come down or go up, but generally you work on the basis of margin per tonne, and your EBITDA margin varies depending upon the oil price going up and going down. So I think, real judgment can be arrived from knowing the per tonne margin.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Normally, we have about 80 various grades of products. We generalize it as on the specialty grades and the conventional grade. Normally we work on the EBITDA percentage, normally grade has about 8% to 10% of EBITDA margins, and 14% to 16% on the specialty. So, we have given the guidance on the EBITDA margins between 12% to 14%, and for the quarter, we had about 13.44% as EBITDA margin.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Nilesh Chawla — Shaw and Chawla LLP — Analyst,"Okay, and in fact, in the current quarter, there has been exchange gain rather than loss. So, looking at that gain also, our results seems, I mean, disappointed. We are frankly disappointed with the current quarter’s performance. Maybe on annualized basis, as another participant rightly said that H1 was better, in spite of so many headwinds, and in fact, we were expecting that the current quarter, you could have done a little better in the volume also, as you guided in the last con-call that there is good demand and selling high-value product is not a problem, especially in the domestic market. You did sounded some concern in the export market, but you say that local market is doing well and we should be able to grow by 50% volume. So, [Technical Issues] thought on that and how do you see Q1 and Q2 of the current financial year.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"We have actually seen the volatility been there throughout the whole of the year. And if you see on the yearly basis, there was an exchange loss of about INR12 crores for the year. However, as I’ve said, that we are mitigating most of these risks by adjusting our inventory. On the export front, of course there are concerns and more challenges because a lot of the countries are experiencing tremendous shortage of currencies. There are inflationary and recessionary concerns and challenges. We are mitigating this risk by increasing our presence in more global markets. The exports have, in fact, in this quarter increased to 44%. Overall, we see that it was a very volatile year in terms of the currency, in terms of the crude oil price going forward. We are hopeful that they will be more stability and normalcy and more visibility on the business, and we are hoping for the best.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Utsav Anand as an Individual Investor. Please go ahead.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Utsav Anand — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Hi sir, good morning, congratulations on the good set of numbers. I just want to ask regarding the expansion that we’re doing. Has that been done?",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,Can you repeat your question?,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Utsav Anand — Individual Investor — Analyst,"[Technical Issues] doing for increasing the capacity, that was supposed to be done by Q4 of the last quarter. Has that been completed sir?",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"So, I still didn’t get your question actually. Can you please repeat that?",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Utsav Anand — Individual Investor — Analyst,I was asking regarding the capacity enhancing that you were doing in terms of capacity expansion.,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, so, we have added 30,000 tons in this year, and as per the plan, more than 60% of that capacity expansion has been commercialized in the Q4 of this quarter-ending March ’23. Next year we have another expansion plans of 30,000 tonnes, which is also on the of course, and it is as per the plan.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Utsav Anand — Individual Investor — Analyst,"So, 30,000 tonnes have been added to the production line, right? So, we are trying to get that.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Yes. 30,000 will be added. Now more than 50% has been commercialized, and the rest will be commercialized in the coming months.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Utsav Anand — Individual Investor — Analyst,By when it will be commercialized? By which? quarter one?,PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"No, Quarter four of this year.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Utsav Anand — Individual Investor — Analyst,[Technical Issues],PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,"Utsav, can you use the handset, you are not very clear.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Utsav Anand — Individual Investor — Analyst,"The entire 30,000 tonnes has been commercialized right? [Indecipherable] was last year.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, about 50% has been commercialized in this quarter and the balance will be in the Q1 of this year.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,"Thank you. Mr. Anand, I request you to join the queue for any follow-ups. The next question is from the line of Javed Hassan, an Individual Investor.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Javed Hassan — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Good morning, sir. Sir, my question is how are the export markets range and what is your assessment going forward.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, as I already answered the previous question, we have seen some challenges on the export markets due to the geopolitical issues. And a few of the countries where we are supplying our products are facing tremendous currency shortages. Further, the recessionary and inflationary concerns are imposing greater challenges, however, the company is able to mitigate these concerns by expanding its reach to newer markets. For this quarter, the exports have increased to 44% of the total revenue.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Javed Hassan — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Okay, Thank you, sir.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manpreet Singh as an Individual Investor. Please go ahead. Manpreet, your line is unmuted. Please forward with your question.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Manpreet Singh — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Okay, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I muted myself. So, Mr. Rayani, I wanted a clarification on two fronts — one is regarding this FY — regarding this expansion of 30,000 which happened in Q4 of FY ’23, and as you mentioned that 50% has already been commercialized and remaining 50% is left. So just wanted to understand, I think in one of the earlier calls you had mentioned that some testing had to be done before commercialization happen. So, what is the reason this remaining 50% hasn’t been commercialized yet, is there some testing going on or what is it?",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"No, this is actually, we normally commercialize in batches, so about 50%, the testing was all done and already we have started commercialization of this new capacity. And in the batch wise, for Q4, we commercialized about 50% of this new capacity and another 50% will be in this quarter. It’s a batch wise process.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Manpreet Singh — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Okay and I think that by end of this financial year FY ’24, you have another, let’s say 30,000 tonnes coming up online. Correct?",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"That’s right, that’s right.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Manpreet Singh — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Okay, okay, now my second part of the question is around the industries that you serve. Are you — so pharma was particularly weak for different chemical companies that were serving pharma sector, so last couple of quarters were weak for them. So are you seeing that thing improving for yourself or pharma sectors and even the other sectors you serve. Are you seeing weaknesses or strengthening in those other sectors as well apart from pharma?",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Hussein Rayani — Joint Managing Director,"I think the major segments where we saw good growth was in the textile segment for us, textile oils we manufacture antistatic coning oil and [Indecipherable] oils which goes in the texturizing units. So we saw good demand in that segment. Further, we had — we saw some good demand in the white oils, which goes in most of the cosmetics industry and also in the industrial lubricants. So these segments, we saw some better performance and growth.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd. 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that would be our last question for today. I would now like to hand the conference back to Mr. Hussein Rayani for closing comments. Thank you and over to you, sir.",PANAMAPET,Panama Petrochem Ltd.

Vikram Vilas Suryavanshi — PhillipCapital India Private Limited — Analyst,"Thanks, Rico. Good morning, and very warm welcome to everyone. Thank you for being on the call of BCL Industries Limited. We’re happy to have management of BCL with us here today for question-and-answer session with investment community. Management is represented by Mr. Kushal Mittal, Joint Managing Director.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Vikram Vilas Suryavanshi — PhillipCapital India Private Limited — Analyst,"Before we start with the question-and-answer session, we’ll have opening comments from the management. Over to you, Kushal.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Thanks for the introduction, and also thank you to PhillipCapital for hosting our earnings call. Good morning, everyone. We would like to extend a warm welcome to the earnings call for the fourth quarter and financial year ended 2023.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Let me start by giving you the key financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Total income for the quarter was around INR458 crores, including Svaksha, which is a decline of 10% on a year-on-year basis. EBITDA for the quarter was INR48 crores, which increased by 16% year-on-year basis. EBITDA margin stood at 10.47%. The net profit was around INR25 crores, which is an increase of 7.4% [Phonetic] year-on-year basis. PAT margin stood at 5.37%. It is important to note that the revenue contribution from Svaksha for the quarter was at INR74 crores and EBITDA was at INR9 crores, which is an improvement from the previous quarters.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"For the financial year ended ’23, the total income stood at INR1,827 crores, which is a decline of 8.7% year-on-year. EBITDA stood at INR130 crores, a decline of 10.6% year-on-year and margins were at 7.13%. PAT was about INR64 crores while PAT margins were at 3.5%. For Svaksha Distillery, the total income for the financial year was at INR187 crores, with an EBITDA of INR11 crores.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Coming to the operational highlights. I would like to start with the Distillery segment. BCL distillery unit at Bhatinda continues to operate at 100% capacity utilization with good demand for both ENA and ethanol. And the company also hopes to commission the 200 KLPD expansion of ethanol by the end of June 2023. This should have a positive impact on the company’s financials moving forward.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"To combat inflation in fuel prices, the company has commissioned its paddy straw based 11 megawatt power plant in Bhatinda in the second half of May 2023. The company expects this power plant to bring down the fuel costs for the Distillery segment significantly moving forward.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"For ENA market, March and April month are considered to be lean months as a new excise policy is renewed during this period. This has led to a slightly lower demand for ENA in West Bengal, and the company expects its sales from West Bengal plant under its subsidiary Svaksha Distillery unit to be good moving forward.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,The expansion plans for the additional 100 KLPD are ongoing. The company expects to commission this plant by December 2023 with a project cost of around INR90 crores.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,There has been a significant increase in EBITDA margin for the [Technical Issues] ’22-’23 in the Distillery segment and this has happened due to very good demand for ENA and the company’s strong inventory management during a period of fuel price inflation.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"In the Edible Oil segment, there was a dip in revenue for the quarter, which was due to the drop in global edible oil prices globally. Despite the dip in revenues, the company was able to get 4.5% in EBITDA margin from this sector due to strong inventory management. Global edible oil prices have decreased at about 30% to 40% when compared to the previous year, while the company’s revenue from edible oils have only decreased by 26.5%. This indicates that the company has not decreased its volume being processed from this sector. The edible oil prices continue to be in a decline as I speak and we are waiting to see how this market stabilizes.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Lastly, in the real estate segment, in its attempt to reduce the financial burden of the company, BCL has continued to utilize revenues from the real estate to liquidate its debts, which is visible in the year-on-year results.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"With that said, I would now like to open the floor up for any questions.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Questions and Answers:,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mayur Liman from Profitmart Securities. Please go ahead.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Mayur Liman — Profitmart Securities — Analyst,"Thank you for the opportunity. I just want to ask, right now, how much of distillery do we have and how much capital utilization per distillery for the Q4 and the full year? If you provide the number distillery-wise, it would be very helpful, sir.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"In Bhatinda, we currently have 200 KLPD of ENA and ethanol and for the entire year — last year, the capacity utilization was at 100%. In Kharagpur, we have — in Bengal, we have 200 KLPD in ethanol and ENA again, and this plant was commissioned in July of 2022, but there were some problems that we ran into. So I think, since then, the capacity utilization has been at around 70% for that unit. But now, moving forward, we hope for that capacity utilization to be 100%. And in next month, we expect to commission another 200 KLPD of ethanol only at Bhatinda and once the plant is fully commissioned, we expect the capacity utilization to remain at 100% for that expansion as well. And another 100 KLPD of ethanol is to be added at Svaksha before the calendar year ends.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Mayur Liman — Profitmart Securities — Analyst,"Okay. Sir, and my last question, how do you see the financial year 2024? What is your expectation from the next year and the outlook for the next year? If you provide the guidance on the segment-wise, it would be helpful for me.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"For Edible Oil segment, we are hopeful of a stable year but I can’t speak with too much certainty in this sector as of now, because the market is at a free fall as we speak. And what we’re experiencing now wasn’t expected. So we hope to get about INR1,000 crores in revenue from this sector in the next financial year as well. But let’s see how and where the market stabilizes and when the market stabilizes, because that is not easy for me to predict, as I said right now. On the Distillery sector, we hope to and expect to get a revenue of around INR1,500 crores in the next financial year.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Mayur Liman — Profitmart Securities — Analyst,"Okay, sir, thank you so much, sir.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Thank you.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Mayur Liman — Profitmart Securities — Analyst,That’s all from my side.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Thank you.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nirav Seksaria from Living Root Capital. Please go ahead.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Nirav Seksaria — Living Root Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, sir. Sir, I wanted to ask — I had a similar question on the Distillery segment. So sir, going forward, how much is the margin that we expect out of — from the segment?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, I think, right now as we speak, margins from the Bhatinda unit, we expect them to be good moving forward, and a big reason for that is the paddy straw based boiler, that will significantly decrease our fuel costs. So we expect these margins to remain around 18%, if not more. For the West Bengal unit, due to some changes in the excise policies, there is a decrease in demand in Bengal for ENA as compared to the past. So we expect those EBITDA margins to be around 15%.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Nirav Seksaria — Living Root Capital — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, one more question on the Distillery segment again. Sir, have we tied up with any major brands for bottling of Bhatinda facility?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"No, we haven’t — we don’t have any bottling tie-ups with any major brands as of now. We just supply ENA to the brands and that includes the major brands of India but no bottling tie-ups.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Nirav Seksaria — Living Root Capital — Analyst,"Sir, any plan of entering into the bottling for these brands?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"For the Bengal unit, we are looking. And I think conversations are taking place, but none for Bhatinda. In Bhatinda, we’re bottling under our own brand: Punjab Made Liquor. And the sales are increasing monthly. So we hope to get over 1 million cases done in this year and I think if we can build on that, moving forward, then we won’t need a bottling tie-up in Bhatinda.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Nirav Seksaria — Living Root Capital — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, just one more question. Sir, any [Technical Issues] level of operational blend — the level of operational blend we see from the Distillery segment going forward in the FY ’24 and FY ’25?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"I’m sorry, I couldn’t understand the question.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Nirav Seksaria — Living Root Capital — Analyst,"Sir, going forward, how much revenue can we expect out of — from the Distillery segment?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, so this current financial year, we are aiming for the Distillery sector to give us around INR1,500 crores in revenue.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Nirav Seksaria — Living Root Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Sure, sir. Thank you so much.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Thank you.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh [Phonetic] from Oman [Phonetic] Investment Advisors. Please go ahead.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Hi, good morning. So I have a few questions. Regarding the Distillery segment, so earlier we used to achieve around 17,000 — till 20,000 kiloliters per quarter. So now even West Bengal I think it’s not up to 100% utilization. So in this quarter, we can expect around 35,000 [Phonetic] kiloliter on overall consol distillery, sir?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Bhatinda is continuing to be at 100% capacity utilization for the current quarter that we’re in right now. I think for the Bengal unit, we’d to be able to get 90% capacity utilization. As I mentioned in my speech, since excise policy is renewed every year in March end, so in March and April and even May, a lot of times, are considered to be very lean months in terms of ENA sales because even the bottling units has a — changing as per the excise policy and all that. So for this current quarter, we are expecting around 90% and hoping to get 100% moving forward.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,"And just a follow-up on that one only. We have a good demand in Bhatinda for ENA, so if Bhatinda 200 KLPD is commissioned, then we can go for 100% ENA from the old 200 KLPD capacity? Or it can be…",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"That is the long-term plan. But before we do that, the current plant needs a revamp, some work needs to be done, which will take about a month. The order for that work has been placed and placed in advance, so that the towers — the distillation towers are ready in time. And we’ll be taking a shutdown in, I think, September or October to revamp the plants, so that the current 200 KLPD can only be used on ENA and the expansion on ethanol.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Okay. And going forward, what will be the volumes of Distillery we expect in Q3 or Q4 after this Bhatinda also commissioned? So I’ve done some math, earlier we used to achieve around INR100 crores from Bhatinda 200 KLPD. So if I do some — yeah, per quarter.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,In terms of revenue?,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,"No, in Distillery only.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,In terms of revenue?,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Revenue, revenue, yes, yes.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Yes.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,"So in going forward, if I do some math with the coming capacities, the revenue would be around INR1,200 crores, sir. Is it fair to assume the same figure?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, INR1,200 crores before the Svaksha capacity kicks in. And post that, I think we can aim for INR1,500 crores once the 700 capacity is installed and commissioned. See, INR100 crores used to be a ballpark figure, yes, per quarter. But what we’ve seen in the past is that ENA prices have increased and so have ethanol and DDGS prices. So now we achieve about INR125 crores quarterly revenue from a 200 KLPD plant, average.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Okay, and lastly on further expansion plans, you guys have told that you have plan to expand further to 500 KLPD or some green energy projects. Any update on that? Could you please share?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, Bhatinda, we have moved file for 150 KLPD expansion, post 400. The environmental clearance file is ongoing and it’ll only move forward once the new plant has been commissioned. And see, firstly, we want to properly commission the 700 KLPD and be confident in its working and then look at expansion plans. Yes, we want to expand post the 700 KLPD, but I’ll be only able to speak with full certainty once this is commissioned.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,"And lastly, if I can ask that whatever the power plant or boiler we have commissioned, out of which, how much we can save through fuel cost from Bhatinda?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, out of my 400 KLPD commissioning that will be done, 60% of my fuel and my power and my steam can come from the new power plant. And this will give us significant savings. If I were to speak on per liter basis, then I’d say INR2 to INR3 a liter can be saved from this new power plant easily.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,Okay. That’s all. Thank you. Thanks a lot.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Shlok Dave [Phonetic] from CAO Capital. Please go ahead.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity. So just a clarification to the previous statement that you made: 60% of the power from the 11 megawatt new power plant. But is that for the expanded 400 KLPD or existing 200 KLPD?,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, that will be for the — 60% of my steam and power will be from the paddy straw boiler for 400 KLPD.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"For 400 KLPD, okay.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yes. So that will be for 240 of my — so I’ll require about 100 tonnes of steam and this should give me 60 tonnes, so about 240 KL would be from the new power plant.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,You will require 100 tonnes of steam for 400 KLPD.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, yes.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Okay, great, great. And sir, just a clarification on some of the calculations. So what is a good assumption to take for effective number of days? If you’re operating at 100% utilization, this 200 KLPD or 400 KLPD, that needs to be multiplied by 365 because I know for a fact that there are routine maintenance shutdowns that every company has to take? So…",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,330 would be a good ballpark figure.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"And that is every year, right? It’s not like every other year you will do maintenance. You will do maintenance shutdowns every year.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Maintenance shutdowns are quarterly, so to speak, because the plant does require cleaning every — once a quarter. So on an average, you can do 330.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"Right. So again, if I get my volume at — if I understand the things correctly, you will have probably close to three-fourths of the year for the new 200 KLPD Bhatinda plant. Is that a reasonable assumption?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"[Speech Overlap] By June end, we expect to have that plant commissioned, yes. But as I mentioned, we will be taking the shutdown in our current 200 KLPD plant in this year as well for a month, at least, to have that plant revamped. So once you calculate it, you also have to include that in your calculations.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"Right, right, right. No, that’s okay. That’s again transient thing, temporary thing that doesn’t really — so what made me curious is how do you reach your INR1,500 crore number? Did you mean exit run rate Q4 INR1,500 crore annualized? Is that what you meant by INR1,500 crores coming from Distillery?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"INR1,500 crores, I’m hoping that it will get at least a quarter of 500 [Phonetic] KLPD expansion in Svaksha also. So that’s why…",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"No. That part I understand, sir. What I don’t understand is this INR1,500 crore is an actual guidance for the entire year or is it an exit number for Q4 next year? Exit run rate number. Like divided by 4, so you get INR375 crores, so will Q4 of next year, only that part will show INR375 crores or you will actually do INR1,500 crores throughout the year? Because then my math doesn’t quite add up. I don’t reach INR1,500 crores, given the one month shutdown, given only three quarters probably of the expansion at Bhatinda and then better utilization in West Bengal [Technical Issues] KLPD expansion coming for only one quarter.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"[Speech Overlap] INR1,500 crores, I think we might be — I think that would be a better way to put it was that, in quarter four, we expect about INR375 crores to INR400 crores from the Distillery segment and I think with this one month shutdown, we might — because it’s not — I can’t predict exactly what the number would be because you know there will be an ethanol price increase, which is expected.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"I understand, sir. I understand.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Along with that, ENA prices are also to increase. So could set the INR1,500 crores figure. That’s the target, depending on how much the prices of ethanol and ENA increase and rest of DDGS increases, because if you track the company, we used to get about INR100 crores from 200 KLPD in terms of revenue. And this year we did INR130 crores.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"INR125 crores. Yeah, INR125 crores, INR130 crores, yeah, correct.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, INR125 crores to INR130 crores for the quarter. So that all depends. Yes, I’d say — I think you raised a [Technical Issues]. And I think it would be safer to say INR1,250 crores to INR1,500 crores, anything in that range.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, better have toned down expectations for the market, because INR1,500 crores [Foreign Speech] then there is always a — sir, I would like to understand your edible oil business slightly in a better way. This is something that I don’t understand about the company. So as you said, the market is in freefall as of now, right? So when your margins get compressed, are we talking about a completely commoditized product, where bulk of the compression in margin actually is because of inventory losses? And the spreads, they’re basically maintained and once the fall in the underlying commodity stops, the margins immediately rebound or is it something else which is that the spread itself is getting compressed? Because I don’t have enough data to actually understand what exactly is the ramification of this fall in the underlying commodity on your revenues and on your margins, so can you explain that bit in more clarity? What generally happens? How does this commodity behave?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yes. See, there’s two types of edible oil businesses that we’re involved in. One, which is our specialty and the sort of business that we want to be involved in moving forward is the indigenous edible oil, so that is your cotton seed, mustard, rice bran. That was always our company’s specialty. And once the global edible oil prices starts to fall, these oils don’t give us as much losses in terms of inventory losses because, first, the holding period is much shorter when compared to imported oil. And secondly, we have seen that the prices of indigenous oil tend to be more stable, as opposed to imported oil. There has been — imported oil market has been extremely volatile for the past nine months. And a lot of times, a lot of these contracts are forwards — forward contracts, forward shipments that we book in advance. And that is your CPO, crude palm oil, and your soya bean oil. So once these prices starts to fall, then there is an inventory loss that needs to be booked. The spread doesn’t change, we still work on some margin as opposed to, but the problem is then we’ll have to consider the current buying price of the raw material.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"Can you provide some understanding as to what this spread is — this constant spread? So there are two components, right? One is the inventory expansion and compression, the expansion and compression in the spread because of inventory losses and gains. The second one is that fixed amount, right, that fixed spread which doesn’t change that much.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"That too depends on what edible oil am I using because, see, we have a fully integrated unit that includes the oil mills, solvents, refinery, [Indecipherable] manufacturing unit and also rice mill. So when I’m processing, for example, a mustard crop, then my entire plant is getting utilized. My oil mill is crushing the mustard seed, my solvent is extracting the oil from the cake, and further my refinery is being used for that mustard oil as well. So that is the crop — that is the oil that has value addition on each and every step. For example, even rice bran, we consider it to be good alternate because my solvent is being used for the rice bran, and the cake usually sells at a very good price. So these tend to have a higher margin as opposed to imported oil where I’m importing the oil just refining it and [Technical Issues].",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, please stay connected. The line for the management has dropped. We’ll reconnect them quickly. Ladies and gentlemen, the line for the management has reconnected. Sir, you can go ahead.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, sorry. So, as I was saying, there is no set formula to give you what is commodity-wise my margin but as opposed to the same quarter of last year where we did 4.56% this quarter and 2.97% last quarter, so once we have more indigenous oils to process, we expect better margins. And overall, I don’t expect the margins to — I think what we did this quarter, [Foreign Speech].",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"In any one year when the prices are steady, everything is like normal, right, [Foreign Speech], but in any one particular year when everything is stable and steady, how much ROE can this business generate?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, this business — we expect this business to give us around 3.5% to 4% of EBITDA margin in a stable year and…",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,At what turnover?,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"At a turnover — see, that is also not a very hard question to answer because the prices have fallen by about 40%, 45% now. So we expect to stay at INR1,000 crores of turnover [Speech Overlap].",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"Okay. One final question which is coming back to the distillery business. What kind of price escalations are you expecting? What is the industry expecting? Because the last round which happened, everyone was left — like, it was good, but not that great. Everyone wanted a bit more. So what are the [Speech Overlap] what is your sense?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,We as a company are expecting that the maize prices of ethanol will be significantly increased because the government needs to move in that direction now because the buyer has…,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"Sorry, which prices? Which prices? I missed.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,The price for ethanol made from maize — corn.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"Maize prices. Okay, okay.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, because the government can’t simply rely on FCI rice as being the raw material for the grain-based ethanol industry. See, what we’ve seen this year and there was a conference held in New Delhi in which all of this was discussed. What we’ve seen this year that for the government to promote an Atmanirbhar Bharat and support its agriculture sector, they need to ensure that a farmer is not selling his crop below MSP or below a price where the farmer has to book a loss. Last year, we saw this with mustard and maize and every crop that the farmer grew, we made a very — that crop, we gave them a very good return and that will only help the agriculture sector and that will only help India in crop diversification, which is the — which is a very urgent need as of now. What we’ve seen this year is that maize is selling below MSP and even mustard is selling below MSP and this was — this is in the government’s notice and they don’t want this to happen.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, for a farmer who grew maize this year and they didn’t get the remuneration for it, they’ll go back to paddy next year and they’ll expect the government to buy it at MSP and the government does not want that burden on themselves. So what — as per our reading of the market and the policy, we expect that the government will increase the maize price of ethanol. So that maize that is currently surplus in the market will be bought by distilleries, converted into ethanol and sold to the OMCs. And…",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"[Foreign Speech], maize?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,I’m sorry?,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"You guys can use maize, right?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, we can use maize and we prefer to use maize, it is a more sustainable method for the industry as maize is not as water guzzling as paddy. These grain-based — if you look at the grain-based ethanol market globally, it’s all dependent on maize. India is an outlier, which makes it from rice. So we expect those prices to increase significantly. Let’s see what the government does but I think we should expect those. For the prices from surplus side, I think they — we don’t expect much increase from them.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"Got it, got it. Has West Bengal finally stabilized after the excise policy changes?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, Bengal has stabilized. The production — the factory is working with very good parameters. It’s just that there were some policy changes in the alcohol market, which has led to a significant decrease in sale of alcohol in Bengal. So that had [Indecipherable] a little bit, but we hope that will stabilize in the future too.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,And Q1 will be back to trend levels for West Bengal — trend growth levels?,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Q1, I think we…",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"For the industry, for the industry. You guys — I understand what you guys are going through. But for the industry, liquor sales and alcohol sales in West Bengal, will they mean revert to…",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"It will take some time to pick up because the government has done two things. One, they have increased the prices of country liquor, which has led to the decrease in sales. And secondly, what they have done is for the distillery industry, which is a bit of a negative is what they’ve done is, they have imposed an export fee for us to export ENA out of the state, but they’ve waived the import fee. And historically speaking, Bengal used to be a state which used to have a very high import fee. So they’ve done the opposite now. These are policy changes. They keep changing. I think at one point of time, having a unit in Bengal was more profitable than having a unit in Punjab, and now this has changed and it could change in the future also. So they’re policy changes that keep changing. So all we can do is give our representation and try to nudge the government in the right direction.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Shlok Dave — CAO Capital — Analyst,"Understood, sir. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity and answering all the questions in great detail. All the best, sir. Thank you.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Thank you.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Aditya Surana [Phonetic] from Niveshaay. Please go ahead.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Aditya Surana — Niveshaay — Analyst,"Sir, good morning. Sir, can you please tell me the order book currently? And how much time it will take to complete the order book?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,The order book of what?,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Aditya Surana — Niveshaay — Analyst,For ethanol.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Order book of ethanol, I think we have till November end to complete the contract. And I think for the Bhatinda unit, it’s set around INR4.5 crores, for the year, to INR5 crores [Phonetic] and for the Bengal, it’s around, I think, INR3.25 crores, and we expect to commission — to complete the entire quantity. And as we speak, we might even put more quantity. So the order book can increase because there has been a new cycle that was just introduced this year. We’ll still look at it and put in more quantity.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Aditya Surana — Niveshaay — Analyst,"Okay. Sir, can you explain the cost structure of ethanol in liter terms, like raw material costs, if you’re near towards INR42 and fuel cost is INR58, can you explain me the whole cost structure?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, for a tonne price, we expect — the industry standard is 450 liters of ethanol, that could change depending on how efficiently you’re working a plant or how efficiently you’re not working a plant. And then about — depending on your raw material, about 18% recovery is DDGS, which is currently selling at INR27 a kg I would say. And then there are your fuel costs, which are about INR12 a liter and then there are other costs, your salary, maintenance, finance cost. So I think you can do the calculation from there.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Aditya Surana — Niveshaay — Analyst,"Okay. Sir, can you tell me the EBITDA margin going forward?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"I had mentioned this earlier. I think for the Bhatinda unit, we could expect around 16% to 18% in EBITDA. These are all, I think, quite conservative numbers that I’m giving, and for the Kharagpur, around 15%.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Aditya Surana — Niveshaay — Analyst,Okay. So how much revenue can be generated from a 100 KLPD plant in a year?,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"A 100 KLPD plant should give you around, I’d say, INR270 crores of revenue.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Aditya Surana — Niveshaay — Analyst,"Can you explain me the calculation like 100 KLPD plant, it would be converted into — by multiplying by 1000? I mean, it could be showed at INR60 near about. So can you explain me the calculation?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, 100 KLPD plant should give you about INR3.3 crores in spirit. If you multiply that by INR58, that is INR191 crores or INR192 crores and the rest is in DDGS sales. DDGS, CO2 and then there are other sales — [Indecipherable] sales also that you can include. So all those that included.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Aditya Surana — Niveshaay — Analyst,"Okay. Thank you, that’s all. Thanks you.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Thank you.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ankur Kumar from Alpha Capital. Please go ahead.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Ankur Kumar — Alpha Capital — Analyst,"Hello, sir. Congrats for a good set of numbers, and thank you for taking my question. Sir, on the edible oil side, you are saying that things are looking tough. So do you expect current margins of 3%, 3.5% to stay or you think it can go even lower from here?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, margins — the processing margins, we expect them to be stable. We don’t expect much of a decrease in them. But the only thing is the inventory — the loss on the inventory is what we’re worried about as we speak. So we don’t expect the market to remain the way it is right now. But let’s see what happens.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Ankur Kumar — Alpha Capital — Analyst,"But like for our segment-wise reporting, do we carry high-cost inventory which can give us losses or how should we look from BCL…",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, there are some forward contracts that we have to do on imported oils. So that is usually — as I was explaining, indigenous oil is not much of a problem because they’re not as volatile as imported oil, firstly. And secondly, the holding period for them is much shorter. We can buy mustard seed from the market, process it and sell it, whereas imported oil, the holding period is much longer and there are future contracts also that we need to fulfill. So that is a bit of a worry.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Ankur Kumar — Alpha Capital — Analyst,"Got it, sir. And sir, on the distillery side, you are saying INR1,500 crores revenue for this year. So like over INR350 crores per quarter and currently we are at INR200 crores — around INR200 crores.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"So I have been corrected, I’d say around — I’ll make the change of about INR1,200 crores to — around INR1,200 crores. It can go up above that also, depending on the escalation in ethanol and ENA prices.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Ankur Kumar — Alpha Capital — Analyst,"And so basically, like, the jump will come in from second half or how should we expect the revenue jump from this segment?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, revenue jump in quarter two, I think there should be another expansion of Bhatinda that will add to the revenue. And we expect the Svaksha unit to also operate at 100% capacity utilization, which you know, in the past, it hasn’t. So that will add to the revenue as well. So I think INR1,200 crores is a very conservative figure in terms of revenue.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Ankur Kumar — Alpha Capital — Analyst,"So basically, Q1 will improve marginally and then Q3 — Q2, Q3 will…",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Q2 will — yes, you’ll start to see much of the impact.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Ankur Kumar — Alpha Capital — Analyst,"Sure, sir. Thank you and all the best.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Thank you.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rahil Shah [Phonetic] from Crown Capital. Please go ahead.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Rahil Shah — Crown Capital — Analyst,"Hello, sir. Good morning. You mentioned things have been stabilizing in West Bengal after the policy changes, and then you mentioned that Svaksha Distillery will be good, moving forward. So by when do you expect this?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"No. I think from — I think our quarter one results will be better than the previous. And then moving forward, it will be better.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Rahil Shah — Crown Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay. And you’ve given your views on individual segment-wise margins. So on a consol level like how do you see this? So I think we’re currently at around 7%, so flat — it’s been flat year-on-year. Do you see improvement by the year end?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Consolidated margin?,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Rahil Shah — Crown Capital — Analyst,Yes. Yes.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"I think as the revenue share from our Distillery sector increases, so will our margins — consolidated margins.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Rahil Shah — Crown Capital — Analyst,"Okay, but like these are sustainable numbers otherwise?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, if I were to look at my EBITDA margins for last financial year, it was at 6.61% as opposed to 7.22% this year. And with an increase in Distillery revenues, I think this can go up to 8%, 8.5%.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Rahil Shah — Crown Capital — Analyst,"Right. Okay. All right. Thank you, all the best.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Thank you.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh from Oman Investment Advisors. Please go ahead.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Thanks for the opportunity again. So regarding this oil segment, so do you expect any inventory losses like in Q3 when [Phonetic] we had posted some inventory losses? Do you expect the same thing in this quarter?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"I can’t comment on that right now. I think I’ve already spoken enough about the market. And I can’t predict where this market will be one month or 15 days down the line, to be honest. As of now, it’s very volatile, so I really can’t make a comment on this right now.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Balamuralikrishna Junalgadh — Oman Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Okay, thank you.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Manan Shah from Moneybee Investment Advisors. Please go ahead.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Manan Shah — Moneybee Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, congratulations on a good set of numbers and a wonderful gesture from the promoters on foregoing their share of the dividends. My question was on the Svaksha. So wanted to — what feedstock are we using as fuel for the Svaksha Distillery?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, now for ENA, most of my feedstock is maize. So ENA primarily, I would say, maize. For ethanol, it’s FCI rice.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Manan Shah — Moneybee Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Okay. So my understanding is that if we use maize, the yield that we get as against rice is lower.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, the alcohol yield for maize is lower as opposed to rice. But the DDGS yield is higher in maize as opposed to rice. So our calculations are based on what the DDGS prices are and what ENA prices are and what maize and rice prices are. That’s when we decide — after looking at everything, that’s when we decide what raw material to use. So maize currently is cheaper in Bengal. As Bihar is surplus in maize this year, so we decided to use maize as a feed for the ENA.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Manan Shah — Moneybee Investment Advisors — Analyst,"So on an absolute basis, the revenue that we will generate by using maize against rice, will there be any significant difference or we don’t expect any significant difference, either on the upside on the downside?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Maize as of now is more profitable than using rice [Indecipherable] right from the market. So looking at that, we’ve shifted to maize and I have given — I expect the EBITDA margins to be around 15%, and that being — that is looking at the maize prices currently.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Manan Shah — Moneybee Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Okay, understood. And what are we using for power and fuel as a feedstock over there?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Mostly husk, some of coal.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Manan Shah — Moneybee Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Okay. So if at all, coal prices trend downwards, then we can expect further improvement over there?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, the coal prices have been softening. And we are looking at our future contracts for coal. So yes, I think that should help a little.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Manan Shah — Moneybee Investment Advisors — Analyst,And if rice straw also available over there and is it possible that we can…,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Rice straw won’t be possible in Bengal, firstly, because in Bengal, people use this rice straw for other uses. Their cattle — it’s used as cattle feed also or it’s used at many other — there is not a problem of rice straw being burned by the farmers, it’s being used by them. And secondly, to install a rice straw-based power plant is a huge colossal task, it requires a lot of space and I reiterate this again, we’re the only alcohol company in the country that will now be using rice straw as a fuel and it was a colossal task to collect this rice straw, store this rice straw. I’ll give you an example. For next year, I need 120,000 tonnes of rice straw for the entire year as my fuel. And I have a 15 day period to collect this during the harvest period. Either the farmer will burn this or either I’ll collect it from him. And I need about 120 acres of land to store this for the entire year.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"So this requires a lot of preparation beforehand to plan and collect this rice straw and store it. But this is a strategy that will pay us dividends moving forward because fuel has been a problem in the past and we don’t expect this to go away very soon and we have a very good alternate fuel now as a source. And even the capex on a power plant that will run on paddy straw is almost double as opposed to a coal-fired or a husk-fired power plant. So a lot of hard work has been put into this. And in Bengal, unfortunately, it’s not possible, because there is not a problem of surplus rice straw.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Manan Shah — Moneybee Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Understood. Fair point, fair point. Thank you. I’ll get back in the queue.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Thank you.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Narendra [Phonetic] from RoboCapital. Please go ahead.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Narendra — RoboCapital — Analyst,"Hello, am I audible?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Yes.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Narendra — RoboCapital — Analyst,Yeah. So you talked about the edible oil and two capacities added in the indigenous and imported. So is there a definitive split between the two right now that you’re seeing?,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"See, the changes, it varies depending on the demand. So right now, as we speak, I think most of the plant is running on imported oil. This changes, if mustard prices are to increase and farmers starts selling the mustard again, then we’ll start running on mustard again. The problem is that the prices of mustard have fallen down so much that the farmer is not interested in selling. So there’s not much availability of the raw material.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Narendra — RoboCapital — Analyst,"Okay, so there is not much that you can do about it, right?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Yes.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Narendra — RoboCapital — Analyst,All right. Thank you so much.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Siddarth Malhotra [Phonetic], who is an Individual Investor. Please go ahead.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Siddarth Malhotra — Private Investor — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. Most of my — in fact, almost all my questions are answered but I would like to use this opportunity to just make a housekeeping point here. The moderator just mentioned requesting participants to ask maybe one or maximum two questions, but about 20 minutes back, there was a particular participant who took away 25 minutes of the con-call. That is downright ridiculous because this con-call is not a tutorial, it’s supposed to be answering questions from investors. So that’s the point for the moderator to keep in mind. That’s my only point. Thanks very much. Otherwise, most questions are answered.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Neeraj Jain [Phonetic], who is an Individual Investor. Please go ahead.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Private Investor — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. So my question is regarding the commissioning of the Bhatinda plant. So if I remember correctly, when we had the last investor call sometime in February, the management had mentioned that we hope to commission it by end of that quarter. So I would assume they meant end of March. Now, we are hoping for the commissioning to happen by June end. So any specific issue we are facing with the commissioning like we faced with Svaksha or can you please help, sir?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"No, no, no, there is no particular issue like Svaksha. Svaksha was, I think, one-off issue where a column that was delivered was faulty and it didn’t perform as per its requirement. In Bhatinda, I think a big problem that is — that I think everyone is facing is that a lot of these machinery suppliers are quite booked and they’ve been delaying a lot of things from their end, a lot of [Indecipherable] items do get delayed sometimes. And keeping that in mind, that’s why we decided to commission the power plant before the distillery and — but this time, we hope and we expect that the deadline won’t change.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay. And my last question related to Svaksha is that, you mentioned for this quarter the capacity utilization would be around 90%. So can we expect a revenue of around INR110 crore from Svaksha for this quarter? Or is that an over-estimation? Thank you.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, the line for the management has dropped. Mr. Jain, please stay in the queue, I will reconnect the management quickly, thank you. The line for the management is reconnected. Mr. Jain, you can go ahead with your question.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Sorry, you were asking about Svaksha?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Private Investor — Analyst,"Yes, so as you had mentioned that for this quarter, the capacity utilization would be around 90%. So I was just asking about the revenue estimate for this quarter for Svaksha. Will it be like around INR110 crores, because you mentioned that 200 KLPD plant, generally the revenue would be around INR125 crore per quarter. So is INR110 crores a fair estimate?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, I’d say around INR100 crores to INR110 crores, you can probably consider that much for the quarter.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay, and can I ask one more question, please? That would be my last question.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Yes.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Private Investor — Analyst,"Yeah, so for your allotment — the placement that you had done, so I understand that as of now, 25% of the amount has been paid in by all the investors. So any timeline when the rest of the 75% would be coming in, in the company? Because I understand you would be using it to reduce your working capital, right?",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Yes.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Private Investor — Analyst,The loan that you have [Speech Overlap] working capital.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,No such timeline as of now. I think we have 18 months from the receipt of 25%. So no specific timeline.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay, thanks a lot.",BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Thank you.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. That was the last question of our question-and-answer session. I would now hand the conference over to the management for closing comments.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd 
Kushal Mittal — Joint Managing Director,Yes. I would like to thank everyone for tuning in on the call and asking very insightful questions and we hope to deliver on everyone’s expectations moving forward. And thanks again.,BCLIND,BCL Industries Ltd

Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to the Landmark Cars Q4 FY ’23 Earnings Conference Call hosted by ICICI Securities. [Operator Instructions]",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,"I now hand the conference over to Mr. Basudeb Banerjee from ICICI Securities. Thank you, and over to you.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"Thanks, Lisa. Good morning all participants. Thanks to Landmark Cars management for giving us the opportunity to host the call. We have with us the senior management of Landmark Cars represented by Mr. Sanjay Thakker, Promoter and Executive Chairman [Phonetic]; Mr. Aryaman Thakker, Executive Director; and Mr. Surendra Agarwal, Chief Financial Officer.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"So without wasting any time, over to Mr. Sanjay Thakker for his initial comments followed by Q&A. Over to Sanjay bhai.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, thanks, Basu. And it gives me immense pleasure to be with all of you again. This is the second call that I’m having with you. It’s a new journey for us. We got listed just under six months back, and it’s a good time to be listed, I guess. So India as you know has become the third largest market for passenger cars, which is where Landmark operates. And we believe that there is immense amount of headroom here still for growth, and I’ll give you a few statistics to kind of emphasize on this point. In India, only 4% of the dollar millionaires buy luxury cars. The global average is 60%.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Stepping back, let’s understand what has happened in the passenger car segment of India. Over the last few years, there has been a shift towards premiumization. And when I say premiumization, more than 40% cars, and this statistics is around three months, four months old and it may have improved even further. 40% of the vehicles sold are now above INR10 [Phonetic] lakhs. 45% of the vehicles, which are sold are SUV or Equivalent. And I was reading The Economist a few months back, and there was a specific issue on the future of automotive in the world. And interestingly, Economist came to a conclusion in the article went on to say that India would be the only large market which will be growing in the years to come.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"It seems that globally the automotive sales has peaked out, and this — India is the large market, where there is a significant amount of headroom. And I believe that this is not a hidden fact, and that is why there has been a significant focus from all the global OEs, who see this as the possibly the only market, which will show growth, which will be a sustained growth for a length of time, and that is why they are investing in India big time. Only in January, Mercedes Global CEO, Ola Kallenius came to India, I had the fortune of meeting him, spending some time with him. There was some discussion about what will Honda do in India.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"They have announced that for the — till 2028, they will be launching a new car every year. BYD, which is the largest company for B-SUVs, and electric cars has given extremely bullish ambitions for Indian market, where they are talking about nearly half of all electric cars sold in India, they want to be selling by 2030. Now this is what is the Group which has been booking. We are — at Landmark, we are — we believe that we are there right place kind of right time. We are the largest partners as you know for Mercedes-Benz, for Honda, for BYD, for Jeep, for Volkswagen. And I’m happy to kind of announce that only yesterday we got the LOI for MG Motors for Madhya Pradesh, some parts of Madhya Pradesh.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"And so we have added one more brand, which is focused on SUVs and EVs. That is what we are looking at and, of course, the premium cars. I will also dwell upon a little on how the dealership model operates, what is it that we really do for a living. And before I go there, I would also like to state that the — there is — we are seeing a revival in the commercial vehicle sales also. We have been invested in dealership of Ashok Leyland and which is showing a good amount of traction, which is what it did last year and we believe that will continue even this — in this year.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So Landmark which was established 25 years back, today has 4,000 employees, we are in eight states, 105 outlets, and we are the largest partners for all the guys, all the OEs that we spoke about. The dealership model is very easy to understand. Most of you would have kind of experienced this by being a consumer, but from the back end, let me give you a perspective of what we really do. So we sell cars and we make money by way of commission when we sell cars. We make money when people buy insurance and take finance for the cars that they buy. 75% of the people in India who buy cars — buy — take finance to buy the cars. This is I think much higher than the global average. 90% of the people who buy the car buy insurance from the dealerships, and this is a long-tail business.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Landmark has been focusing on this for a long time. Apart from this, when people buy cars, they also buy accessories. And Landmark has been amongst the pioneers in kind of white labeling. I don’t think of any other dealership group which has white-labeled accessories on display. We also have tied up with global car care products from Australia and America, where we are their exclusive distributors in India to market high-value, high-margin products, Permagard and MotorOne. So this is one part of what we do.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"The second and which is the annuity type of a business that we do, it is the business of after-sales or service. And this is the business which has been growing at 20% CAGR for the last nine years. I’m happy to state that for the year ended ’23, this has grown at 25%, which has been a slight improvement over our compounded growth that we have seen. I have told this to some of you separately that one in three cars that you see on road meets with an accident every single year. So not only do we do regular servicing of vehicles, we also do accident repairs. Now this is something which is just keeps on happening. Also as a new foray, what Landmark has done is that last year we have gone into our own white-label extended warranties.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"In the models where we know that there are not too many claims, this allows us to sit on the money, the customer stickiness happens, the customers come back to our own workshops, and we make another revenue stream that gets opened up. So this isn’t a new initiative of Landmark and you will see a lot of profits coming in from there in the years to come. What else do dealerships do? Dealerships have been globally doing a great job in pre-owned cars, buying and selling of pre-owned cars. The Indian dealerships have not been very good at it. And I must say that till now, Landmark was also very average player in this space.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"And the reason is simple to understand. There was the ecosystem consisted of well-funded people who were burning money while buying and selling used cars. And I don’t need to get into the details, you all know who we are referring to. And since the funds have dried up, they have all or most of them have withdrawn from the business. So this is where we believe that Landmark which is a strong franchise and customers know of it, we are well poised to enter this space and make it our own. Globally, 30% of the — of a pre-owned car sold are by the new car dealers. In India, this number is just under 4%, and this will change when Landmark enters this space and which we have entered this year.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"What are we talking about? We are talking about customer, the same customers, the same brand, the same infrastructure, that is what we are talking about. The problem with the industry was that there is not enough on the table. If you set up a new outlet, if you employ new people, you do repair cost, you do marketing, then there is not much on the table because the average selling price of a used car is much lower than the new car. What Landmark has thought of and I believe that this is a kind of a winning thought, and that thought is that we will be using the same showrooms, the same manpower, the same set of customers who are inquiring with us to buy those pre-owned cars, to buy the new cars possibly or the pre-owned cars and sell it to them.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"And we are internally looking at doing — we have an internal target of 10% of all our showrooms, we’ll have to sell pre-owned cars of the same brand from the same showroom. Now this is a journey which has begun and we are internally very hopeful, we are setting our systems, right. And I’m happy to state that the investments that we had made for evaluation of the used cars through artificial intelligence and all is now coming into play. And this will be something that will keep on happening in a good way in the times to come.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So pre-owned cars is going to be a focus, extended warranty for us is going to be a focus. We will be also adding two new brands. MG has also been — already been announced. Some discussions are on for inorganic growth, we will kind of let you know as and when that also happens. The focus of the Company clearly is profitable growth and high ROCE. So this is something we will continue to be focusing on, and the results are with you, I believe you will — you would have gone through it. We have declared a dividend of 45% also once if it is approved by the General Body.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"And I think I will take your questions later on after Surendra kind of completes. But all in all, thanks for being on the call. Happy to be here.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. Hello. Thank you, Sanjay bhai. Good morning, everyone, and a very warm welcome to one and all attending our earning conference call. I would like to highlight some operational metrics for you all to better appreciate the performance over the quarter and the year, which is a consequence of our strong moats we have built over the year. We are the highest contributor in terms of volume for multiple OEMs that we partner with and thus over time, this translates into meaningful volume in terms of the cultural service and the sales.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,"In last financial year, we have sold 21,310 cars across all our OEM partner. We serviced 3,79,054 cars in FY ’23 and expect this continue grow plus 20% year-on year as highlighted by Sanjay bhai. This is the extremely predictable business with repeat customer. We also point ourselves as the inflection point in certain OEM, post which we expect to be on course to see tremendous growth. A major trend been observed in this study, but sustainable rise in the average selling price. The average selling price of cars has gone from INR14.15 lakh to INR17.71 lakh in FY ’23, showcasing a growth of 25% year-on year on the back of higher production of top-end variant being sold and all-round price escalation.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,"As highlighted in the previous earning call and our results documents, we mentioned that there is a change in the Mercedes sales model, and thereby for a like-for-like comparison, we continue reporting the pro forma revenue and the reported revenue in this quarter as well. Our pro forma revenue for the quarter stand at INR1,213 crores as compared to INR970 crores in Q4 last year in FY ’22. This symbolize a growth of 24% year-on year. Sequentially, this has remained flat with the previous quarter at INR1,203 crores reported. Reported revenue for the quarter stand at INR854 crores as compared to INR727 crores in the similar quarter of the previous year, a healthy growth of 17.5% year-on-year. Sequentially, this has all slightly dropped in the previous quarter, it was INR874 crores.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Moving to the profitability metrics. Our gross profit for the quarter stood at INR161 crores as compared to INR141 crores in the similar quarter of the previous year and compared to previous quarter is at INR159 crores. So it’s higher than the previous quarter and very high of the same quarter in the previous year. Our EBITDA for quarter stood at INR64 crores as compared to INR56 crores in Q4 last year and INR70 crores in the previous quarter. On the margin front, EBITDA margin clocked at 7.5%, the same stood is 7.6%, but that is mainly because of the sales mix we have the higher volume — revenue in the sales. Lastly, the PAT for the quarter stand INR24 crore plus, and this was previous year at INR19 crore.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Now moving to the full year performance. Our full year pro forma revenue stand at INR4,595 crores as compared to INR3,369 crores in the previous year. This growth is around 36% year-on-year. Similarly, reported revenue for the year is INR3,382 crores as compared to INR2,977 crores in the previous year, which also shown a 13.6% growth.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Moving to the profitability of the year, our gross profit stood INR613 crore as compared to INR477 crore in FY ’22. Our EBITDA FY ’23 stood at INR250 crore as compared to INR187 crore in the previous year. On the margin front, EBITDA margin clocked at 7.36% as compared to previous year, 6.27%. Lastly, the PAT stand at INR85 crore. The — this is in the previous year stood at INR66 crore for the same period. Lastly, speaking about the return metrics, the return on equity for the year is 23.75% and ROCE for the year is 20.5%.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you. Now we can open up — yeah, now I’m handing over to Sanjay bhai to speak some words.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, before we go to Q&A, I’m reminded of the book I read Outliers some years back, and it talks about right place, right time in history. So we believe that we are at an inflection point, and just as the book says it’s good to be having established the network in the difficult times. We are here to kind of do the operating leverage, sweat the assets more, not only focus on opening new outlets but do profitable business. And we believe that the increase in the average selling price of the vehicle which Surendra spoke about the increase in the revenue per vehicle service that we have done, which has also grown over last year will have a good growth opportunity for us in the years to come, and we are at the right place, right time.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah. Thank you. I think, Basu, I hand it over to you or Lisa whoever for the Q&A.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,Questions and Answers:,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Rahul Dani from Monarch Networth Capital. Please go ahead.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Rahul Dani — Monarch Networth Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. Good morning, Sanjay bhai. Congratulations on very, very strong set of numbers. So just a couple of questions from my end. If you could just highlight the potential of the new dealership you opened with MG? What kind of sales they have been doing and how many stores — how many showrooms will you be opening for that?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, sure. So let’s look at MG Motors, which has been a decent SUV and electric car manufacturer in the world. There have been reports in the media, which are yet to be confirmed of — they’re getting the investment from an Indian partner which will make them grow and set up a new factory, which has been a constraining thing for them. So this is the backdrop. The new models are to be introduced and the ambitions of the Company are very high. We will be — we have got the LOI for the cities of Indore and Bhopal from them. And this is something which will be set up very quickly.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,We are looking at doing this in the next three months that we will be — we are looking at being up and running. And Madhya Pradesh as a market is between 1% and 2% of say close to 2% of the all India sales for most brands. So this is how it will be because there is a decent amount of car park already over there. My feeling is that we will also be having our service operations being profitable immediately as we start.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Rahul Dani — Monarch Networth Capital — Analyst,Sure. sir. Is there any indication on how many stores you would want to open with or start with?,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,As of now two stores.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Rahul Dani — Monarch Networth Capital — Analyst,"Two stores. And also sir, just if you could highlight how the performance of BYD has been maybe on a small base, but how is the acceptance of consumers, especially in markets of Delhi, Bombay and UP, where we are present and what kind of numbers are they clocking, if you could give some kind of indication?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, sure. So, BYD, as we know is the largest EV manufacturer in the world and they have given kind of a big ambition for themselves to do. Right now I believe that the Atto 3, which is what we are selling apart from the E6 has gone in for the homologation with the ARAI. And once the homologation approval comes in, that’s where the numbers will go up. And I will take this opportunity to kind of tell about something else which I missed in my opening remarks. And that is that the — we believe that the second half of the year for us is going to be much better than the first half.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"And the reason why I’m saying this is that the Honda, new SUV, Elevate, which we have all been waiting for and it is showing tremendous traction, it has to be global launches next Tuesday, 6th of June. The supplies of that will start only around August, September. One, the GLC of Mercedes-Benz, which is amongst their largest selling product is right now not available. everything is sold out in this quarter, and the new GLC is getting launched again in the next few months. And typically, and all the SUVs or Mercedes-Benz are in a waiting period, and we believe that the supply situation will only improve one month, two months down the line. So this is one thing.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Even the BYD, the cars will be loaded in the second half. That is what we believe is happening. The numbers right now, Rahul, are restricted because of the non-homologation of the vehicles, which will — and what it means is that there will be a cap of two and a half thousand vehicles that a company can sell in India without homologation. That number — that constraint goes away as soon as the homologation happens.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Rahul Dani — Monarch Networth Capital — Analyst,"Okay, sure, sir. And just a final question from my end. So you alluded about the pre-owned vehicles and when we look at the likes of AutoNation pre-owned vehicles is a significant portion of revenue for them, but our margins also similar for pre-owned vehicles on EBITDA and gross leverage?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah. So people have been talking about higher margins for pre-owned vehicles than typically the new vehicles. What they have been missing is that — and this has — this was quite well articulated with one of the companies that exited this business. And what they explained and which is what has been the Landmark view for a very long time and which kind of that company echoed finally saying that the average selling price is lower, the margins are higher. Typically, 8%, 9% is the gross margin in used cars, it can go to 10% also, but you need to be conscious of the cost that you incur after that.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"The gross margins are all good, but if you have a kind of a showroom to pay rent for or if you have manpower to kind of separately to sell it, if you have evaluators, if you have a repair and refurbishment thing, which is in top, you have a marketing budget and all that and customer acquisition, which is a big one, all that makes it unviable. So what we have thought of is that we have inbound traffic of customers who are wanting to buy the vehicles that we are selling.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"And that conversion right now for 100 inquiries that we get for new cars in a typical showroom, only 10 inquiries gets converted to final sales, 90 inquiries don’t. Many of these people are not able to buy the vehicle because of the price quotient because they find the price a little bit out of their budget, but they clearly want that brand, that’s how they have inquired with us. So we believe that there is this kind of traffic that is natural to us. Aryaman who worked in AutoNation, and since you spoke about AutoNation, I’m taking this chance to elaborate. They had one of the stores where 30% of their sales happened in that store by way of upgrade from say a C Class to an E Class, where people who came in for service, they were given an offer to upgrade for a slide with a one-level high or a two-level high product.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Now these are the things which we will be doing, we will be — since we have invested a lot in technology, our Chief Technology Officer and Aryaman’s Landmark transformation team of 35 people who are working with data analysts and data scientists and the CTO who has joined us from Mahindra & Mahindra, we are working and doing some good quality work to kind of give this technologically enabled answers and solving the question — this pre-owned car puzzle. We are hopeful that we will be able to solve this and crack this, which has not been cracked by anybody else.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Rahul Dani — Monarch Networth Capital — Analyst,"Sure, sir. Thank you for the detailed answer. Thank you, and all the best, sir.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,Thanks.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pritesh from Lucky Investments. Please go ahead.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you, sir, for the opportunity. My question is with respect to the ASP rise that we have seen in the year gone by, which has moved from, let’s say about INR14 lakh per car to about INR18 lakh per car.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,Yes.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"Just wanted your comments in terms of what was the volume growth of Mercedes? And how has the share of Mercedes in your revenue increase? And what is the outlook on this ASP per car as you would have budgeted for the coming year in terms of whatever the new models of Honda or new models of Mercedes, it would be very helpful for us then to understand what can be your revenue growth potential?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, this is a very pertinent question, Pritesh, you are absolutely right. What has happened is that there has been a like-to-like 15% growth, I believe increase in the Mercedes ASP, the same model, the prices were increased by approximately 15%, if I’m not wrong in the last year. What is happening is they’re talking about Mercedes-Benz right now since you touched upon it, 25% of the vehicles sold of Mercedes now or slightly more than that are above INR1 crore, which I’m talking about is with GST, it’s gone up 25% above INR1 crore. Now this number was never happening.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Today, there has been a shift towards the higher-end vehicles of every brand. There has been a focus by Mercedes-Benz clearly to sell cars which are the Maybachs, the AMGs, the S-Class and all, what we call internally the TEV, top-end vehicles and the focus is going to be even more on that. On 1st of April, Mercedes-Benz increased the prices again, which hasn’t been seen in the last year results. The supplies of the top-end vehicles right now which is a — which was also a constraint will also hopefully ease out. So this is something which is going to happen.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"We are going to be seeing not only in Mercedes-Benz, Honda also, the ASP will increase because also understand, Pritesh, that we are — we have been working with in the last quarter a constrained supply situation and which I had touched upon in my previous call, where because of the emission norms which came into play, real-time drive emission which came into play from 1st April, some of the models of the manufacturers work discontinued completely.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"For example, the Honda Jazz, the Honda WR-V, the Jeep, the Petrol Compass. So this is something which was and for to some extent still in the first quarter of this year is a constraint for us to sell vehicles. This is all going to change in the second half, not necessarily the second half as time goes by some next month, some after two months, but everything in the second half clearly. But we will kind of adjust and estimate what we will kind of — the — and we are also going to be seeing a mix where we will be seeing a good amount of BYD vehicles, where the ASP is going to be higher. We have also discontinued our Renault stores with a lower ASP. So I believe that it’s difficult to put a number right now, but the ASP is going to be much higher than what we had last year.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,Okay.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So we will have the ASP higher, we will have a volume growth in each of the brands that we are operating. And we will have a service revenue, which has been kind of growing at 20% CAGR. So it’s a healthy mix of growth that you will see in our case and the new OEs that we will be adding.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"Is it possible then to share what was the Mercedes ASP growth in FY ’23 and the volume growth or volume numbers in FY ’23 out of this 21,000 [Phonetic] number that we have?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,We are as of now not giving brand-wise breakup of things. If you…,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"No problem, sir. Or the other way, is it possible then to share how much of this volume of yours is mass market volume? So you have mentioned that you have — you have mentioned in your presentation, INR10 [Phonetic] lakh and below is largely mass market. So in this 21,000 [Phonetic] number, at least you can share what is the mass market volume number here?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Sure. I will work it out and, Pritesh, send it to you. I may not have it handy immediately, but I’ll be happy to share it with you.’",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"No problem. My second question is on the repairs and maintenance business, where you mentioned that one out of three cars do usually come because of repair. So in this R&M business, how much portion of that business is actually maintenance business, which is the normal servicing business which happens with car company or workshop?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah. So around 40% to 45% of the business is what we call the body and paint, what you are calling R&M, repair and maintenance — it’s called body and paint or accident repair. So around 40% to 45% of our revenue comes from accident repairs. And this we are focusing on increasing in this year. So the monies are paid for by the insurance company. The customer really is not impacted financially adversely. So but currently this is the number, we believe that it will increase over a period of time.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"And my last question is, sir, on the used car business which you have started this year, what is the volume that you expect to do from used car? And considering all the dealership put together, what is the expected revenue growth that you are looking from the car dealership?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah. So I’ll touch upon the used car thing, and we want to kind of maybe going ahead report it separately, also if we are able to, where we are going to be focusing on the used car business, right now it is clubbed in the new car sales as one of the parts. We may bring it out, it will not be very meaningful contributor, but we are internally looking at approximately, let’s just put a number of around INR150 crore of pre-owned cars looking at the average selling price being a much lower. So INR150 crores to INR200 crores of cars is what we will want to sell — buy and sell.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Now this mind you is over and above the exchange that the Company does. 25% of the vehicles that we sell, there is a back to back. There is a kind of we sell it immediately to the broker because those cars that we get in exchange are different brands of cars. So that we will not be wanting to buy on our books. We will — we have no wherewithal of selling those after buying it, a lot of people are doing it, but we don’t think that, that is something that can be done. So we will be giving it back to back. Only our branded cars is what we will proactively buy from the market, and in case of exchange if it comes, we will be doing it.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So as I said the — in number terms, we will — we are focusing right now of reaching 10%, say a showroom is selling 100 vehicles, the target for that showroom is going to be 10 vehicles of the same brand, which are pre-owned to buy and sell it. It’s a long journey we are embarking upon and we need to get it right, nobody in India has been able to do it the way we are wanting to do it now.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"And overall revenue growth, sir, in the car dealership?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So see the point as I answered this, it is a very difficult question because the new car launches are sometimes going one month or two months here and there, which we have seen in the past also. Supply is also an issue sometimes. So — and we are adding new brands. So to basically put a number with only 2024 as the goalpost is difficult, but what I can say is that we will be significantly outpacing the industry. And that outpacing maybe four times, five times at least of the industry growth because of the ASP growing, the volume growth that we will see, the new brands that we are adding, the acquisitions that we will make and the after-sales business which you have seen is the most predictable business and the annuity type of business that we are talking about.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Pritesh Chheda — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"Okay. Thank you very much, and all the best to you, sir.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,Thank you.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gaurav from Maxpro Investments. Please go ahead. Gaurav, your line is in the talk mode. Please go ahead. As there’s no response from the current participant, we’ll move on to the next that is on the line of Krishna Kukreja from Lucky Investments. Please go ahead.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Krishna Kukreja — Lucky Investment Managers Private Limited — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, sir, thank you for the opportunity. I just had a couple of questions. First, I just wanted to ask about the progress in the RDE models for Jeep. You had spoken about the fact that it had on the Compass, etc. So how that has progressed and when do we expect to have those models back? And secondly, you spoke about the used car business. Just wanted to understand when we’re doing the used car business whether these cars will sit in our books as inventory or not? So if you can just give a clarification on that?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, sure, Krishna. So the Jeep Petrol, what has happened is that we have stocked up on the Jeep Petrol vehicles, Compass, that have gone out of production. Right now, we believe that it is not going to be available at least for the next six months, that is the visibility that we have. The company assures us that they are working on this situation and trying to solve this issue. And we — but there has been a big amount of focus on the diesel, the marketing and the payout that they are giving us, they are trying to support us by way of financial health, while this model is not available. So difficult for me to put a date for that.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"As far as the pre-owned car stock is concerned, we are mindful of the fact that not too much of our capital should get sanctioned into this. We believe that we will be investing approximately INR20 crore on a rotating basis for this business and because this is a game that we’re playing and we should get it right. We will be holding stock of not more than one month for any of these brands. So it’s a very detailed budget that we have worked on, and we believe that this will be a good outcome finally.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Krishna Kukreja — Lucky Investment Managers Private Limited — Analyst,"Thank you so much, sir. Also, so if you could touch on Volkswagen and Honda, etc., in terms of the RDE norms? And when do you expect to see a pickup there and what kind of quantum we can look at in terms of outperformance?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So as far as Volkswagen is concerned, there has been absolutely no — nothing that impacted their sales as far of the — because of these norms. So we have the businesses as usual. In fact, the government norms have been that the cars manufactured before 31st March could be sold. So this is something which is giving a fillip wherever we have some stock in the factory of these cars, they’re at a slightly cheaper price than the normal upgraded one. So that is also helping sales.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"As far as Honda is concerned, they have forever discontinued the Jazz and the W-RV and are now going to be focusing on the Elevate, which is the new SUV, where as I said, there is a tremendous amount of buzz around. We have got so many inquiries before the car has got launched, that I have very little doubt that this will be big success. So the pillars of Honda will be three, the Amaze which sells very well in our markets of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. The Honda City which is an evergreen product. And the Elevate, which is going to be launched in the next week but the supplies and the deliveries will start only end August, that’s the information we have.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Krishna Kukreja — Lucky Investment Managers Private Limited — Analyst,"Right, sir. Thank you so much for the detailed answer.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,Lisa? Hello?,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,"Sorry, sir.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,Yeah.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,We’ll take the next question from the line of Rajesh Dhiman [Phonetic] from ICI Limited. Please go ahead.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,Hello? Am I audible?,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yes. Yes, Rajesh, you are.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity, sir. Sir, my first question is looking out maybe over the next three-year to five-year period, and like I say, we’re in the cusp of different revenues could open up the initiatives or develop the opportunity you mentioned already. What are our growth plans in terms of regional expansion in terms of how much of that will be driven by more number of dealerships? And what exactly we look at when we set it up because obviously it will be top-down in our metros and traffic cities, and then because there are certain sort of — so what are your thoughts on our expansion over the next five years?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah. So, Rajesh, what we have been — and this is coming with around 25 years of wisdom. We have also kind of failed in some of the things that we have done five years, seven years back and we are now wiser. So it is very easy to set up an outlet. And to show that my number of outlets have from 100 become 200, it is the easiest thing in the world to do, but there are manufacturers who are like commodity players. And this is something which if we go to them, they will be happy to give us 10 outlets, 20 outlets and all that.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"But that is not what we will be focusing on. Our growth will come from OEs that we believe are deeply committed to the products that we are wanting to sell and what are those products that we want to sell. We want to sell ASP of INR10 [Phonetic] lakhs and above, that we are putting some kind of a benchmark, because that’s where we believe India is growing — going, that is where we believe we are good at. We are premium and luxury players. We can’t be going into mass market. So we will refrain from doing that as far as possible.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"What we have also done is that we have gone deep in the geography. The recent MG example also kind of demonstrates that. What does it mean? It means that say in Madhya Pradesh, we are already dealers for Mercedes-Benz and Honda. Now with MG, our costs will get a portion. We will have operating leverage happening with senior management bandwidth, which will also kick in over there. But having said that, we are wanting to go to certain geographies, which are growing. We have gradually gone to eight states. We will go to clearly more states, some of the high-growing Southern states are also our focus.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So this is something we will do, but we are not putting any number saying that these 100 outlets should become 200 outlets or 300 outlets. The thing that we are wanting is a profitable sustained growth. We don’t want to go berserk in growth instead of say for example, we grew 40% last year, would we have grown 100%, 200%, clearly, but then the profitability would have taken a beating. So we believe that we are in for a structural kind of a change in India. And this is something which we — if we take — if we walk our normal pace, which is acquiring dealerships when they are available looking at build versus buy that we will be significantly outpacing the industry and keeping the profitability and ROCE high, which is like 20%-plus. And that is something which is satisfying us, and I’m sure it will satisfy everybody who walks this journey.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,"So, sir, this tough question really is what kind of growth we see possible or feasible, let’s say, 20%, 25% kind of number is possible or will it always be like dependent on [Indecipherable] and market growth?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"See, we are in a product which is also dependent on the economy, it is dependent on how the auto industry grows, supply chain demand, but it is for me, as I’ve said in the earlier question by our colleague from Lucky Investment, my target will be to outperform the industry by four times or five times in the years to come. Now that is our internal thought process. Now it may come by way of average selling price going up. It may come by way of new outlets that we will open. It may come by way of the volume expansion that will happen with the same OEs. It will be a mix of all that. But this is something which we believe will be possible for a long length of time.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, I have another question on the pre-owned, let’s say, planning. Just wanted your thoughts. There are already some start-up also there in the game. And some of them are marketplace kind of a business model, whereas some have inventory carry, and obviously, we have a higher turnaround time kind of a target. But generally what’s your observation in, let’s say, you have — you won’t hold a stock for more than a month, and are these kind of targets really feasible and where is the average industry in this business currently at on these parameters?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, so this is — yeah, yeah, yeah. So Rajesh, the issues that the startups that you are referring to have failed in the aspect of generating profits for themselves. So whatever they are doing clearly hasn’t worked. So, I have seen franchise models, I have seen marketplace, I have seen stores. I have seen a lot of stuff which has not worked.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So there is really no point in going that way. A lot of good money has been thrown at this problem. So we are coming up with an innovative model, which will not show any exponential top line thing, but it will be a sustained business. It will be one more pillar in our new car showrooms and our workshops where we have natural traffic of those vehicles coming in.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Today, at Landmark, we have close to 1,000 vehicle which visit us every day for service. Are we going to be able to pick and choose some good cars from them — from there and sell it through our showroom? To me logically, and to our team, the answer seems a resounding yes.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Now, will this be a profitable business? We will only be continuing with it if it is generating profits. So we are not after any kind of GMV. We will look at a sustained business model because we have the supply. The problem with all these start-ups that you have been talking about is that they do not have a quality supply of used cars. In our case, we have those quality supplies coming to us every single day of the same brand. You understand? I don’t need to spend a single rupee in marketing. Can we give offers through our workshops? Yes, the answer is yes. Now, this is what is our — is our unique business model, and if we are able to crack it, everybody will be happy.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,Okay sir. Thanks a lot for the answers.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We’ll move onto the next question that is from the line of Namit Arora from IndGrowth Capital. Please go ahead.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Namit Arora — IndGrowth Capital — Analyst,"Yes, thank you for the opportunity. Sanjay, my question was around the trend you are seeing, because globally also luxury sales, in general, across categories have been very strong. Now, given your experience and given where you think India is in terms of the affluent cycle and you know sort of moving to the next level, would you say that structurally the next five years to 10 years could be extremely strong for you, given what you’ve seen in global markets as well.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, I completely agree Namit. There is — I’ve never been more convinced about this. There is a structural change and what are we talking about? Mercedes-Benz India sold 15,800 units or thereabouts last year, which is 2% of what was sold in China around the same time. The total luxury market in India has not crossed 40,000 units so far, which is 1% of the total overall passenger car market.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Now, this is amongst the lowest in the world. In China, this number is 7%. I’m — forget China, in countries like Korea, Taiwan sell more luxury cars than what we do. Now, with the structural change happening, the newer generation coming, the S-Class, average age of S-class buyer today is 38 years-old. Now five years back, it may be maybe seven, eight years older.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So India, the escalation [Phonetic] levels are increasing. There is really now no shame in kind of showing your wealth. We had a kind of a social thing that was making a constraining thing and in my — through my experience, I am telling you a car which was 1 crore and above people thought was like an overkill. Now, today they are routinely sold. So for me, I’m seeing this as a structural change. The Mercedes-Benz factory has 40,000 plant capacity, which is — which is not even full 50% today.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So everybody thought that India will be at a much bigger — in a much higher sale zone than what it is today. But maybe our time has come now and over the next 10 years, I believe the journey is up. We may have some supply issue here there. So I’m looking at the next five, 10 years, not necessarily the next month or the next quarter.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Namit Arora — IndGrowth Capital — Analyst,"Got it, very helpful Sanjay bhai. Just one more question. Now given that you have a very strong and old relationship with Mercedes and other brands as well, but the number of outlets that you have today, you know it’s probably not proportionate to the kind of relationship on the potential of Mercedes as you mentioned. Now, about 26% of your outlets are being strategic acquisitions. So post the IPO and otherwise, are you seeing more people gravitating towards you as potential sellers and even Mercedes at a strategic level engaging with you to do something strategic in terms of just deepening and broadening the relationship?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Namit Arora — IndGrowth Capital — Analyst,"And, as you mentioned earlier in the call, buy versus build, but do you think that the 26% that you have, but that buy strategy might be more accelerated, given that you have a strong balance sheet and you maybe a natural port of call both from sellers as well as the Mercedes as a company might also prefer that.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah. So, let me kind of give you a slightly longer answer. The point is that the number of outlets; we are looking at adding an outlet only and only if it is necessary because it’s a cost center. If it is helping me financially, we will be happy to do it. Globally and in India also, Mercedes India is shrinking it’s size of the showrooms, because the cost-of-sales is an important factor that they are looking at and I really salute them for being this kind of far sighted way.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"I was in Tokyo less than a month back where there was a meeting of the large dealers of Asia and Australia and some from Africa and what came out was that the — some of the Asian countries, the largest dealer partner for them, had a market-share of around 40%, 50% and thereabouts. And this is something which I believe will happen, the companies globally, the global players, really want to deal with fewer entities.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"This is a top-down kind of an approach that they have and they want to deal with financially strong people who are able to give good experience, people who are consistent in their approach. So I have confidence that going ahead, our market share with everybody that we are partnering with, that has been increasing gradually as you will — you have seen. And over a five, 10-year horizon, the number I’m sure will be pretty much more than what you are seeing by a distance.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Namit Arora — IndGrowth Capital — Analyst,Got it. It’s really helpful. Thank you Sanjay bhai for the very detailed answers and all the best to you and the team. Thank you.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,Okay.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We’ll move onto the next question that is from the line of Deepak Lalwani from Unifi Capital. Please go ahead.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Thank you, sir and congratulations on the good set of numbers. Sir, my question was on your input of the H1 being lower than H2. So, if you can possibly take us through what sort of an impact that you see in H1 and the set of announcements that you’ve made and the possible outlook for H2, if you can possibly elaborate on this aspect, which you mentioned? And does this also mean that the first half will be weaker on a Y-o-Y basis as well?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"See — let’s look at it from where I came from. The thing is that the supply is something that we are dependent on the OE. And this is something which we do not have absolute clarity. Over the last several years, our H1, H2 mix has been, say 40-60. That has been kind of a historic distribution. The auto industry works this way. The second-quarter is better than the first, the third is better than the second and the fourth is better than the third in most cases in a normal year.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Now, we believe that the Mercedes supplies will hopefully normalize from quarter two what we are facing and the new modules will be introduced. We are also looking at BYD getting the [Indecipherable] done. The Honda Elevate is only going to be available from August-September. So it’s difficult — and — but it will be also offset by some MGs that we will be starting. So it’s an evolving kind of a thing. I would not like to break-up this because we ourselves are not very sure, because we are dependent on the supplies which happened, but I’m giving a broad kind of a guidance that the second-half is going to be much better than the first-half because of the things that we know.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,Right. So this is a valid point sir. But does this — should we assume that the H1 would be weaker on a Y-o-Y basis?,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"No, no, I don’t think that’s a good assumption to make because there are things which are happening in a normal way. It’s on a relative basis I’m talking about, not on an absolute number, no.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, secondly. I would just want your view on our margins. As we’re doing good work on the higher profitable business which is our service piece. And also we are sort of indicating that the ASP have to go up and the premiumization has to clear out. You know what is your sense on the margins for the next two, three years?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So what has happened Deepak is that we have increased our margins in after sales, and this has — the realization has also gone beyond INR23,000, which was only when we filed the DRHP and all, we were looking at the figures of INR17,000, INR19,000 and all that. And in no time, this has crossed INR23,000 and touching INR24,000 and the margins have also gone up. The gross margins, I believe in after-sales, which were hovering around 39%, 40% have also — have also crossed that 48% number decisively.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"And this has happened because of the efforts that we’re putting in where white-label stuff is also at play. The Permagard, MotorOne products are also happening [Phonetic]. So this is something which will happen, it will slowly gradually go up, that’s the effort at our end. And as far as sales is concerned, as soon as the new models of say a Honda and all will come, we will see a slightly higher-margin coming in because there will be no pressure on holding stock or to discount it in the local market. You are also aware Deepak that we are amongst the few who have, over a period of time, gradually achieved a situation where we have very little, if at all, local level competition of the same brand, same dealership. So this is something which will play-out well in good times as well as bad.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Sure, sir, this was very useful. And sir, indicatively, can you just take us through the commissions that you make across your OEs. If you can possibly give numbers or if you can just rank them in terms of the highest to lowest in terms of the margin profile across the OEs?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"It is more or [Technical Issues] is concerned, the range is pretty much similar. There is not much difference, because see, the margin is also up…",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,"Hello? Sir, we’re unable to hear you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost the audio from the management’s line, please stay connected, while we try to regain the audio. Ladies and gentlemen, please stay connected while the management re-dials in. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for patiently holding, we now have the line from the management reconnected. Over to you sir.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, is Deepak there?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,He is still in the queue.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Yes sir, yes.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, Deepak. Sorry, my line got disconnected, somehow. So, yeah, I was talking to you about the margin structure. So they are — the margins are a factor of the fixed margin that we get irrespective of the volume we do, and what is — there is a volume-based incentive which are based on our monthly and quarterly and sometimes yearly target achievements. Now this is something that — is it not — the variable margins are not fixed. They are — they move up and down as far as the demand-supply situation at the OE end and the pressure that they have.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So, my personal belief is that because the supplies are all going to be in line this year, the variable margins will increase for the OEs over the last year. And if we are able to maintain that and not pass it on to the market, we will be better-off. So, you asked about ranking of the OEs, I’m saying that the fixed margins are pretty much in the same zone. I mean 4% to 6%, 7% is the fixed margin and then there is a variable margin which keeps on going up and down from say 0.5% to 2% is the range for variable margins, which depend on our achieving those targets for the month or the quarter.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,Right. Sure sir. Those are my questions. Thank you and all the best.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Thank you. Yeah, thanks Deepak.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashwini Agarwal from Demeter Advisors LLP. Please go ahead.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Ashwini Agarwal — Demeter Advisors LLP — Analyst,"Hi, good morning. I had an industry-related question. You know, I mean a large part of your business comes from service and that’s a very sticky business because typically owners of premium cars would like to go back to the dealers who are — who have authorized spare parts and all. What is the risk to this? I mean, a few years ago, the late Mr. Jagdish Khattar started Carnation, but unfortunately that didn’t work. Can you help me understand why the standalone large network you know dealers especially for after sales don’t works and authorized dealers tend to get bulk of the business. Can you help me understand that?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, this is an — actually. I can explain to you in a short way. The issue is that the aftermarket garages have not solved one fundamental question that is the supply of spare parts. Because in India, Ashwini, you will be surprised to know that there is no catalog of spare parts, which is a surprise. People are just starting these things and not only Carnation, we had after that GoMechanic, which came and then it is gone. So the problem that they are not solving is that of the spare part. What piece — whether it is Carnation or a GoMechanic they do is that they come in, buy the spare parts from the authorized dealerships.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Now this single act kills the business, because in billing, today, I’ll give you a breakup. Say there is a INR100 billing, you go to a workshop and there is a INR100 billing that an authorized dealer gives you. Around — for German makes, it is around 70% — 65% to 70% of that is spare parts. Now, if you are going to be buying the spare part from a dealer who will add some margin and give you, what is the elbow room that you have then to make it cheaper and more convenient; forget cheaper, and more convenient. Really there is nothing, no elbow room. Their manpower cost will be slightly lower, the real-estate cost is going to be the same.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"They — the local garages lack the equipment, the softwares which are continuously getting upgraded. So, really there are so many things which are against this whole concept and the manufacturers today are giving long warranties. We at our end, I spoke about selling extended warranties. Now after the OE warranty of say three year ends, we sell another two or three years of warranty. And the prerequisite for availing this is that they need to come to our workshops to avail the service. So really this is some — I don’t see this as a threat at all. At one point I was a little scared, but then we realized that these are money burning models and they really had no legs to stand-on.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"And the accident repair, the total cost is paid for by the insurance company. Now consider a situation where you are given a free lunch coupon and you can do it anywhere that you like, would you go to a local restaurant down the street or you will go to a Five Star. You don’t need to pay for it. The answer is very clear.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Ashwini Agarwal — Demeter Advisors LLP — Analyst,"Okay, got it. And second question I had was that you know on your second-hand business that — your used-car business that you’re talking about, would you be able to do pre-approved or pre-authorized extended warranty vehicles, supported by the brand logo or that’s a separate thing altogether?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"No, no, no, we will be able to do that. Now we will be the only ones who will be able to do it. See the brands also want the residual value of their branded cars to go up because it helps the new car sales in the long run. So the OEs will give an extended warranty, we will give our own extended warranty, service packages, and we will be selling it from the same showroom because that’s also what the brands will be very happy to be allowing.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So it’s actually a win-win situation. I just want to build it up gradually to make it as a sustained pillar. It is not a pillar — a meaningful pillar in our profitability. Our profitability pillars are new car sales, insurance, finance, servicing, and accident repair. But I want to add one more pillar, which will be a great pillar over a long-term of this used cars. But it is going to be a gradual journey. But once we do it, we will do it right and we will do it in a solid way.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Ashwini Agarwal — Demeter Advisors LLP — Analyst,"And going back to my first question, the reason why these standalone workshops survive globally is because there is a proper product catalog and the spares are supplied by people other than the manufacturer himself?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yes, that is also right. And also there are insurance supplied — supported workshops which we don’t have. Today, there is no workshop of size. I don’t know which city Ashwini you are from, but just in your mind, think of the largest local garage that you have seen, and you will get the answer. There is nobody who is there. You will need to create this whole infrastructure all over again and what exactly are you trying to solve over there.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Ashwini Agarwal — Demeter Advisors LLP — Analyst,"Okay, got it. Okay, thank you. All the best.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, thank you.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We’ll move onto the next question that is from the line of Basudeb Banerjee from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"Thanks sir. First, to Ranjeev [Phonetic] is one question. Sir, if I look at your annual balance sheet, inventories have increased quite substantially and payables have come down, which has impacted operating cash flow like last year, increase in inventory in cash-flow was INR80 crores, this year it seems to be INR150 crores, so almost INR70 crores of operating cash-flow getting impacted. So is this increase in inventory temporarily because of some reason or if you can highlight sir.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,"So Basu, in the last financial year, you’ve seen that we have — our OE launching new model in the Volkswagen and Jeep. For catch up [Phonetic] the new model we increase our inventory. It is getting settled in the coming quarters. So that’s the reason of the increase of the inventory. We have a new model launch in all the — like most of the OEs. In Mercedes-Benz — no not in Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes-Benz has a demo car but in VW and in Jeep.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,So basically this March 31st Fiscal ’23 increase in inventory to temporary you mean?,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,Yeah.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"And payables coming down, sir.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,"Payables has come down and in the current quarter, basically the payables is the income incentive which we received from the — you are talking the payable to vendors.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"So, the payables you’re reporting in your balance sheet overall.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,Yes.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"And one thing sir, if. I look at your quarterly revenue. So almost from — for last six quarters, the normal revenue which is not the pro-forma is somewhere around stabilizing around this INR800 crore to INR850 crore a year — INR800 crore to INR850 crore range. So, anything from a directional perspective despite all this growth, even last three quarters one can see revenue is still around the same level.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Surendra Agarwal — Chief Financial Officer,"So, regarding the payable — to answer your payable question, in the last year onwards from March we were having some credit purchase from the OEM, which was basically the goods was in-transit, so that was not there in the current financial year, at the end of the financial year. So that’s the reason for the reduction of the payment. Yeah.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Sorry, Basu if you can repeat the last question, the quarterly revenue you were saying is stagnant, which is the reported revenue. You see Basu, we are looking at the revenue as a pro-forma revenue because Mercedes-Benz, which is a meaningful business in our case, if we only look at reported revenue, only the commission of that is getting recorded.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"So, that implies that ex of Mercedes, other OEMs growth has not been strong this year?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"That is I think a fair thing to say. So, it has been an upward [Phonetic] kind of a thing. But the — years to come, all the OEs are going to be meaningful contributors in our profitability, but because Mercedes has run ahead of everybody, it looks as if that is a winner. But every — it is a cyclical business and the OEs will — once the cars, new cars get launched suddenly you see a spike in revenue, as you have seen in say Volkswagen. Now this year you will see in case of Honda that way.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"Sure sir. Next question is sir, how much time will it take for the inquiry [Phonetic] business to get set ready and deliver?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,My target would be in the next three months.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,Three months? And how much organic capex will we incur for this…,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"We are — year, we believe that it will be under INR12 crores or so, [Foreign Speech] That is budget we believe will be enough for this.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"So it make two pairs, service and sales outlet in each of the cities?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,That is right. That is right.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"And that is included as a part of your normative INR30 crore, INR35 crore capex?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"So, this will be possibly on top of the capex that we will be normally be doing because this is a new company that we will be starting, our subsidiary and that is where we will infuse the capital and pay from there.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"And do the other large OEM, what we have been expecting also, that will also, one can expect that [Indecipherable]?",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,Large OEM what to expect?,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,Any other large association with any other OEMs this year is further possible or one should [Speech Overlap],LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, yeah. No, clearly possible. So Basu, we have been very cautious about who we partner with and a lot of hoops that this question needs to jump, whether it is, do the company has a long-term future, what are the terms that we are getting, what are the geographies that we are comfortable with and that’s when we do. So, yes, the answer is yes. But — and, again it has to be in the premium or luxury side. So the answer is yes. You hopefully will see some more in the times to come.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"But overall capex plus acquisition all put together, that figure of somewhere around INR110 crore of cash outflow. I think that will have an upper cap or that can move up…",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, yeah that is — no, no, we will be mindful of that Basu. I understand where you are going towards. And we have — since we have seen a lot of seasons in lives, [Foreign Speech] is a long way and we have seen a winter of the business between 2015 and ’20 and it is fresh in our mind. So, unless we are confident of having enough money to pay for what we do, we will not do it. And our cash flows from business have to be strong, which they are, to kind of sustain this. So, the growth opportunities are immense in India. The possibility of going berserk also are very-high. So we will not go berserk. We will do a measured kind of a thing, with a focus on ROCE and profitability.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Basudeb Banerjee — ICICI Securities — Analyst,Sure sir. Thanks. That’s all from me.,LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to the management for their closing comments.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd 
Sanjay Thakker — Chairman and Executive Director,"Yeah, thank you. It was interesting things and the year gone by has been quite an eventful one for us. We were the first auto dealership to get listed. I did not answer I was just making it as I looking at my notes and one of the questions that was asked was that will other small dealers kind of approach you for a takeover and all that. The answer is yes. We have — the ball is in our hand. It is for us to drop it, so — or take it past the goal line. And we will make all the efforts to kind of be a part of India’s growth story, which is going to be a decades on running. We are the leader. We will maintain that position and we will make everybody in our ecosystem happy. Thank you.",LANDMARK,Landmark Cars Ltd

I greatly appreciate you all taking time-out today morning to attend this call and. I hope all of you are doing well.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","As customary, I will first take you through the key highlights of our consolidated performance during the quarter and the year ended 31st March, 2023. As Welspun Corp, we once again achieved a coveted 1 million ton global line pipe sales in FY;23. This is eighth time in the 10 years, last 10 years that we have breached this mark. This is only a clear reflection of a very stable and consistent performance in our line pipe business. The revenue from operations stands at INR9,758 crore, it’s a growth of almost more than 50% on Y-on-Y basis. EBITDA for this quarter is around INR483 crore and for FY ’23 stands at INR805 crores.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We have also completed the acquisition of Sintex DAPL and specified assets of ABG Shipyard. We are fully in control of these two assets. On the sustainability side, we have been ranked in the top 7% in the steel industry in the DJSI Corporate Sustainability Index. On top of it, we also have a very strong order book of almost 1.1 million tons — our global order book of 1.1 million tons, value pegged at INR14,600 crores.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","If I move to the quarter performance; for the quarter, the production and the sales volume in our line pipe business. For our total operations including Saudi, was 374,000 tons and 345,000 tons respectively. We achieved a sales volume of [Technical Issues] in India, out of U.S. was close to 30,000 tons and from Saudi operations close to 100,000 tons.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Let me also give you some update and our assessment of the market outlook as we see for it — as we see the key drivers for each of our business. As you know, Welspun Corp is now a conglomerate having interest in line pipes, in steel, in shipyards in stainless steel. So it’s a very diversified and that’s the reason we want to give you a very clear market — our assessment about the key market drivers for each of the business.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","First, coming to the line pipes. The line pipe business has seen a robust performance, sales volume of 345,000 tons in Q4 and almost more than 1 million tons in one year. The overall environment for the oil and gas capex is very favorable across the world. In the beginning of April, Saudi Arabia and the OPEC plus oil producers announced oil output cuts of around 1.6 million barrels per day. The pledge is being, bring the total volume of cuts by OPEC plus to almost 3.6 million barrels per day, which is equivalent to 3.7% of global demand. OPEC Plus has been expected to stick to 2 million barrels per day cuts already placed in the year 2023.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","These cuts is clearly reflecting the stability in the oil market. If you see, the oil market is completely range-bound between $70 to $90 per barrel at this point in time and for the last considerable time. The IEA also said that world oil demand is going to set to grow by 2 million-barrels in 2023 to a record 101.9 million-barrels, driven mostly by stronger consumption. Oil market balances are still to tighten in the second-half of 2023, with the potential for a substantial supply deficit to emerge.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","On one-side, being the production cuts, on the other side, the demand is staying strong, I think so we are very confident and we feel that this range-bound oil — prices of oil will complete — will stay range bound.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","On the gas prices, we have seen that there has been a little softening, but then the demand has been extremely high. As regards to India, the target has been set to increase natural gas consumption from 6% to 15% in our energy mix by 2030. The vision of One National One Grid provides for all necessary infrastructure in this regard. The length of the gas pipeline network in 2014 was around 14,000 kilometers, which has been increased to 22,000 kilometers. In the next four-five years the gas pipeline network in India is expected to reach 35,000 kilometers.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","India is a world third-largest consumer of crude oil, and depends on imports to meet over 85% of its requirements. According to the International Energy Agency, India’s oil demand could rise from 4.7 million-barrels per day-in 2021 to 6.7 million-barrels by 2030 and 7.4 million-barrels by 2040. The country currently has a refining capacity of 250 million tons, and there are plans to increase it to around 450 million tons per annum over the next few years, as India’s oil demand is expected to rise.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Energy scenario across the globe is also gaining, due to the geopolitical [Technical Issues] resulting in a strong export demand. In the export markets, we are in — all what I said till now was for the domestic side of it, we see that the domestic demand is going to be a strong, we are we are contemplating that the investment in the oil and gas infrastructure will continue to happen, as it has been happening for the last four years and we see for the next four to five years, this demand is bound to be there in the infrastructure space.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","On the export market, we are in active discussions for several other orders across the world. As you are aware, we recently-announced the award of an export order to one of the countries in the Middle-East. It is approximately 83,000 metric ton. These pipes will be supplied for offshore production and transportation of gas, which will accelerate and enhance LNG export infrastructure in one of the largest LNG producing and exporting country in the world.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","There also has been a revival in th -water sector by the strong pent-up demand after a subdued growth over the past two or three years. Our wide geographical presence within India, which means our presence in West, Central and Southern India, along with a very robust supply-chain is optimally — will help us to cater to this emerging demand.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Coming to U.S., which is also one of the mainstay in our earnings. We are seeing that record LNG exports from U.S. has helped soften the blow to Europe from sharply lower Russian pipeline natural gas supply in 2022, and will remain a vital energy source for the continent even in 2023. Rising global demand for the metal, gas is a growth opportunity for U.S. LNG producers, and — but delivering on this opportunity will depend on timely construction of natural gas line pipeline infrastructure, to support new LNG gas supplies.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","At this point in time, our spiral plant is fully booked [Phonetic] until December of 2023. The current business environment is very favorable. We are seeing lot of tailwinds and we are in active discussions to book new orders beyond December 2023, and we are very optimistic around the same.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Coming to Saudi Arabia, I’m sure you all are noticing the exponential growth which is happening in Saudi Arabia. Today, Saudi Arabia has the highest annual growth, rated among the world’s 20 biggest economies in 2022 and according to the latest data of OECD — and have plans for a huge growth in infrastructure projects. Saudi Arabia is is expanding its maximum sustainable oil production capacity to 13 million-barrels per day-by 2027. In this regard, Saudi Aramco is greatly expanding the capacities of offshore oilfields, which is a crucial element of its strategy to boost the country’s oil production. Its own capital expenditure in this year is expected to be between $45 billion to $55 billion, with capex increasing throughout the decade for the next 10 years.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","In the recent quarter, Saudi Aramco reaffirmed joint venture to move forward with, with their capacity expansion program. The long-term outlook remains unchanged as they believe oil and gas will remain a critical component of the global energy mix for the foreseeable future.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Saudi Arabia is also expanding its gas production capacity and aims to achieve a 50% growth in the gas production by 2030, so both oil network, oil production network and gas products network continues to be a key focus attention in Saudi Arabia, and as you are aware that recently, our associate company in Saudi has signed a contract with Saudi Aramco for supply of large diameter steel pipes, which is valued at almost INR4,000 crores. This is one of the single largest order our Saudi company has won from Saudi Aramco, and it represents a major share of the first package of Master Gas Phase 3 program. With this order in-place, our plan is booked for the next one year, if not more.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We are also seeing a robust demand in the water sector with multiple lines to carry desalinated water to be awarded shortly, out of which we are in any case poised to win some more orders in due course of time. Now water company SWCC is investing in increasing its capacity to desalinate, transport and store water to meet increasing demand and further enhance water supply security. Given the vast geography of Saudi Arabia, the transportation of desalinated water, it’s demand center is of very key importance. Where today around 13.9 million cubic meters per day can be transported across the country. This capacity is currently being increased by an additional 56% and a further expansion by 44% in 2030, which means there will be almost 100% capacity expansion between now and 2013.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","This was my outlook on the pipe side of our business, the pipe vertical. Now I would like to draw your attention to the steel side of our business. We have seen, as you are aware that we have commissioned our blast furnace and our DIP plant. We have seen a steady ramp-up in our hot metal production, almost achieving our target production levels, whatever we have targeted for, we have almost reached their production levels, all included facilities around our blast furnace like sinter, coke oven, PCI and oxygen plants have also reached their targeted production levels and aptly supporting the hot metal production.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","There has been a steady ramp-up in the volumes across the full production range and on expected lines in our DI Pipes business as well. The quality and the timely deliveries are well-accepted and highly appreciated by the customers. To make provision of portable water supply to every rural and urban household the country by 2024, Government of India in partnership with states, is implementing the Jal Jeevan mission. The impetus of water supply infrastructure is continuing with the JV and receiving an allocation of almost INR70,000 crore in the Union budget of 2023, significantly higher than INR50,000 crore, what was allocated in the last fiscal year.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","But DI, as we are aware, it is a business all about approvals and acquisitions. I am very pleased to say that we have already received all necessary approvals and acquisitions in the state of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, which are our top priority areas in any case. We are seeing consistent demand from all the states coming up and have — and I have already supplied and have a track-record of supplying pipes in most of these states now.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","It is very clearly reflected in our performance, we have a strong order book of almost 140,000 tons valued at more than INR1,100 crore, and we are aiming that this year we should be producing and selling — dispatching, selling anything between 175,000 to 200,000 tons of DI pipe, which will almost be 45% to 50% of our capacity utilization. This is this is a ramp-up. We are currently in a ramp-up journey, we are in we are in the first two quarters, and as you would have seen, our quarter-on-quarter ramp-up has been absolutely on the expected lines. I think so in the next three to four quarters’ time, we will be there in terms of delivering the guidance what we’re giving in terms of execution.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","As regards TMT bars, our newly commissioned state-of-the art plant has started ramping-up dispatches. The key target market is the state of Gujarat, where the estimated annual demand is close to 3 million tonnes. Within Gujarat, we have seen a healthy demand in the area of Kutch, wherever plant is located. This will be one of the key priority market for us, due to our strong presence. We intend to be a strong player in the B2C segment and our brand Welspun Shield has been extremely well-accepted in the Gujarat market. We are now considered as Tier-1 suppliers within the producers of Gujarat, on the basis of quality and service.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We have also created a unique and industry-first digital platform for distributors, dealers retailers and influencers.

Our product has successfully reached to 24 districts add 69 talukas across Gujarat through 120 dealers and six distributors. This is bound to grow in subsequent quarters. Our target is to reach to every district and every taluka of Gujarat by the end of this financial year.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","I’d now like to draw your attention to our company, Welspun Speciality Steels, which is our stainless steel part of the company. The stainless steel business has seen a surge in-demand in sectors like defense, petrochemicals, nuclear, reactors and process industries. There is a strong potential in Europe and North-America. Further, the anti-dumping duties on the stainless steel pipes and tubes for cheap exports from China have come into effect, which has significantly improved the business prospects for Indian mills like us.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","In the SS bar business the company has started offering expanded product range from 50 millimeter to 200 millimeter to 25 millimeter to 350 millimeter diameter. We are also working in further expanding this range. This range is a very unique range which we possess, and puts us into a very coveted position. Further the Make in India initiatives by the Government of India is providing further input as to this business.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We have seen a strong turnaround in the performance, both operationally and financially, and I’m pleased to report that WSSL is an EBITDA-positive company in this financial year. The current order books of this company stands at almost 3,500 metric tons, which comprises both of bar as well as pipes, and is pegged at INR155 crore.

These certifications will cover the entire spectrum of their product offering into the market. This is an extremely favorable development for an integrated players like WSSL.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","I am also very glad to inform that the company has booked its first order for a very-high value nickel alloy grade 6625. As you know, this is a boutique [Phonetic] business and as you move-up in the value chain, what are the value-added products you are servicing, and 6625 is considered to be one of the most stringent and difficult and cash accretive grade of the product, and this company has — our company has been able to book the very first order in this particular grade.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd

"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Let me also now draw your kind attention to our recent acquisitions, which is about Sintex and Nauyaan Shipyard which is erstwhile ABG. So let me just throw a little update on that as well. As I said, we have taken full control of the assets at Sintex BAPL. Sintex continues to be a national brand with premium positioning. It is best-known brand of water storage tanks in India, and the brand connect is synonymous with water tanks. When you talk water tank, it is Sintex.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","The company enjoys a very robust distribution network of 900 distributors and 13,000 retailers. They stay intact and are going to act as catalysts for our growth. The current market-share of Sintex in water tanks is estimated to be about 9%. Every effort is now being made to increase this market-share in FY ’24, by reenergizing the distribution network, the product and brand positioning, bringing in supply-chain efficiencies, reenergizing our dealer and distribution network. We are extremely excited about its prospects in the subsequent quarters and years to come.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Nauyaan Shipyard, which is the erstwhile ABG Shipyard. As you are aware, we took the full control of that asset and as I reported earlier, we are currently in the process of liquidating that scrap which is there. So we are moving steadily to monetize the scrap, which should be mostly completed by the end of this financial year. This will result in a steady cash-flow. During this period, we will be incurring a very minimal fixed cost.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Further. I want to make it clear that we are not exploring any capital-intensive options shipbuilding. Instead, we are exploring options with respect to ship repair, ship recycling. In this regard, we are in discussions with various established companies in the world, and doing our internal and doing a comprehensive assessment, which I expect to complete in next two quarters’ time.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","The endeavor will be to come up with a low capex non-cyclical business, high-return and value-accretive proposition, basis which we will formulate our business plan for the next financial year. So what we’re trying to do; three things, number one, we are we are trying to liquidate the scrap, so that it gives a steady cash-flow, number one. We have restricted — we are keeping a very strong check on the fixed-cost outflow. We are not doing any major — we are not doing any capex at all, and we are working in terms of finding out a value proposition for which an exercise is being done, and we will return in next two quarters’ time.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","I also want to draw — to the ESG initiatives, which the company stands by. As you are aware, the company lays a strong emphasis on sustainability and governance, and has been ranked in the top 7% in the steel industry. The DJSI score which reflects this — which recognized this initiative, has now significantly improved from 41 to 57 in FY 2022.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd

Further, it will be our endeavor to utilize cash and it’s further — utilize cash in further reduction of gross debt.

"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Looking at the various companies which are now in the Welspun fold, right. We are I think so it is clear on the market side to expect, that what sort of guidance we are putting in-place. Typically, when we were a standalone pipe company, we were always hesitant in doing that. But I think so in order to bring confidence and give clarity to the market. We have worked out and we are giving you a broad guidance for FY 2024.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd

"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We have completed our acquisition of Sintex BAPL and ABG Shipyard. There will be no capex other than the maintenance capex in this current year. The investments made in all these new businesses will start accruing, and we will see the benefit over the next quarters in the subsequent years. The demand outlook for all these new businesses is extremely healthy. But works need to be done to scale them up from operations and cost point-of-view. We are firmly working towards Har Ghar se Har Dil Tak Welspun, by expanding channels within Sintex’s TMT business.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd

"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member",Questions and Answers:,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] We have the first question from the line of Miraj from Arihant Capital. Please go ahead.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Jain — Arihant Capital — Analyst,"Good morning, sir, this is Abhishek Jain from Arihant Capital. Congratulation on good and improved set of numbers. Sir just want to understand, what will be the sustainable inventory going forward? Because I can understand because of entering into new business, and so, how much inventory we are going to see on a sustainable basis, how much inventory we are going to keep it?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Good morning, Abhishek. I think so it’s a very interesting question you have asked. We have seen an inventory increase in comparison to the last financial year. But you have to understand this inventory increase is because of the growth in all the businesses. The major inventory increase in our U.S. business, where we are executing a large order, and you know, and the entire inventory has been procured and sitting with us, and it is already a built up inventory in any case. But we have also started execution of that order and we will see now a gradual reduction coming up on that inventory side of it in the U.S.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Further, we have inventories in ABG, which is almost valued at INR500 crores, as I said that the scrap sale process is already on and the movement of — as the process will continue, you will see as reduction in the inventory coming there.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","In WML, WDI, of course, the nature of the business is that you have to have maintained an inventory level of iron ores and fluxes and coal and all that stuff. So it’s a fairly normal inventory level of almost INR500 crores will be maintained and it is pretty regular in nature.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","On the WSSL side, we have inventory of close to INR200-odd crore, but this business also has an order book of almost close to four months’ time and then inventory levels need to be maintained. On the pipe side of it, we have an inventory of close to INR1,000-odd crore, I think, which was on account of the export orders, what we have and as the export orders are now getting executed, so this will also start to go down. So we have to understand that the size of the balance sheet, the size of the operations have almost tripled, so I think so that is where you will see that there is inventory which is — there has been a high inventory. But this is all against order and all — as they and — they start getting executed over quarter-on-quarter basis, you will see a gradual reduction happening there.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Jain — Arihant Capital — Analyst,"Sir, my second question is, as per our understanding, we can generate a healthy amount of cash flow in the next three years. So can we assume the next three years, we can be — we can achieve at least a net debt free kind of status?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We can expect what, sorry?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Jain — Arihant Capital — Analyst,Net debt free. What’s your debt free status?,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Abhishek, you have been following this company for a long time, right? As Arihant Capital, we know that you have been following this company. Our focus always has been to leverage our balance sheet very, very correctly. This is not the very first time that we will be doing this. Our strong focus remains on bringing our net debt to absolutely minimalistic level.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We are absolutely on that track. I think so all the businesses, all the new — old businesses, which is the pipe business and the new businesses, which are all shaping up and growing, I think so you’re right, we’ll generate sufficient cash flow and our endeavor would first be to reduce our gross debt at the company level.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Jain — Arihant Capital — Analyst,"Sir, I have Miraj here, we have one more question. I wanted to understand if you could give new highlights on the Saudi order that you’ve spoken of, which is INR4,000 crores, if you could give us what the volumes would be for that? And how many more orders can we expect in the Phase 3 as since this is the first order in Phase 3.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","So right now, coming to the Saudi part of it, this order, as you know, is from Saudi Aramco. It is for a project called Master Gas Phase 3, right? I think so the — this Phase 3 order will be happening in two parts, one in this financial year and the other in the next financial year, right? For this financial year, I think they have mostly placed their orders, and we have got our line shares around that, right?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","So — and this will get — this will — and see that we will have a continuous run for almost one year. On top of it, we are also expecting some orders coming up from the water sector, and we will be absolutely looking those orders very, very closely so that we have a business continuity even after four quarters. So I’m very sure that we will be able to do that. Then it will be followed by Master Gas Phase 3 second phase. So I think there is a clear business continuity case in Saudi business for at least the next two or three years’ time.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Jain — Arihant Capital — Analyst,"Thank you sir. I have a few more questions, I will be in queue sir. Thank you for — again, and congratulations on a good set of numbers. All the best sir.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Thank you. Thank you, Abhishek.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,The next question is from the line of Nirav Shah from GeeCee Investments. Please go ahead.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Nirav Shah — GeeCee Investments — Analyst,"Good morning sir and congratulations on very strong profitability during the quarter as well as the deleveraging. So a few questions. Firstly, we are seeing that while the EBITDA has increased, our U.S. volumes haven’t — I mean, they’ve remained almost flat on a sequential basis. So the last part of the increase is coming from India line pipe operations as also DI is in the ramp-up phase. So if you can just give a broad breakup of the EBITDA during the quarter, that would be really good, and if the EBITDA is led by India line pipe operations, was it because of some, one of marquee high-margin orders or it’s a sustainable number? That’s the first question.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","So Nirav, coming to your first question, U.S. operations are U.S. mill is under full production mode at this point in time. Of course, in this particular quarter, the dispatches was slightly on the lower side, but that they were as planned and as decided, right? I think so from this quarter onwards, you will see the major execution of the order what we have in hand will start and that they will start getting reflected into the quarterly numbers. As you know, we already have an order book of close to 400-odd thousand tons in the U.S. business at this point in time, and we have almost a firm visibility of the — firm business in hand till December of this — till the December of 2023.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","In this particular quarter, I think to the India operations, the large — the major chunk of the EBITDA came from the Indian operations because the product mix in India was very profitable. They had in the kitty, some very remunerative export orders which got executed, and moving forward, I think so the blend of the orders, they are building up in their own — in the Indian kitty is also looking very favorable to me, and I think so we will see the benefit of that coming in the subsequent quarters as well. But as you know, these are just also to add a word of caution that it is also about the product mix on a quarter-on-quarter basis…",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Nirav Shah — GeeCee Investments — Analyst,And that changes depending upon execution.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","That changes our blend a little bit, yes.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Nirav Shah — GeeCee Investments — Analyst,"Got it, sir. Second question, I mean, you’ve given a broad indication of how the — why the inventory has moved. But just coming to the U.S. operations of the INR5,000-odd crores of inventory, INR5,700 crores. How much would be sitting in U.S.? And also the payables have increased because of — I’m assuming because of U.S. operations as well. So on a net working capital basis, will we see a reduction in the working capital at U.S.?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","So to your first question, I think sort of this INR5,700 crores, the large chunk almost close to INR3,400 crores, INR3,500 crores is sitting in U.S. only, and as I said, it is an inventory against an order. One, it has already paid up inventory because the payment terms are favorable there where you are paid upon buying the inventory, and more importantly, as you know, we are into the — as the dispatches will start, you will see in the subsequent quarters, this inventory position going down.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Nirav Shah — GeeCee Investments — Analyst,"Okay, and lastly, before I come back in the queue, sir, what’s the scrap inventory in terms of tonnage that we are holding as of March at ABG.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","As I said earlier, I think that the total overall scrap was close to 150,000 tons in ABG. That’s what we have told earlier as well, and that is what we are in the process of liquidating and it is a very steady manner. It is getting liquidated. But it will take almost at least three more quarters, if not four, before everything will stand liquidated. So it will give us a sort of a steady cash flow for the next two, three quarters and more importantly, Nirav, we have to understand that we have kept, as I said earlier in my call — in the earlier part of my call is that we are keeping our fixed cost at a very, very low level. At this point in time, we are not pumping any money whatsoever in ABG so that just to give you the comfort.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Nirav Shah — GeeCee Investments — Analyst,"Yes, and we mentioned that this year will be only maintenance capex. So on the entire operations with the addition of new businesses, what will that number be?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Yes. Typically, when we used to do a maintenance capex when we only had a pipe business, it used to be in a vicinity of close to, like, say, INR70 to INR100 odd-crores. I think that this time, it could be close to INR250 crores, INR300 crores. Looking at all the businesses put together.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Nirav Shah — GeeCee Investments — Analyst,Got it sir. Got it. Great. Thanks sir and all the best.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Thank you, Nirav.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vikash Singh from PhillipCapital. Please go ahead.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vikash Singh — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Good morning sir and congratulations on a very good set of numbers. Sir, I want to understand our bid book, which have increased basically 46% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. So what are the new geographies where you are seeing the new green shoots and some insight into the European market because after war, it was touted at a very good market but nothing has come from there as of yet. So if you could just give us some insight into that?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Vikash, the growth in the bid book is largely driven from three regions. Number one, Southeast Asia, we are seeing an exponential demand in the Southeast Asian market, one. Two is the Middle East market. We are seeing a very buoyant Middle East market and at least economies in Middle East, which is Saudi and Qatar are absolutely firing up. So we are seeing a very pent-up demand from these two economies, and of course, third is also coming from our U.S. because we are seeing a lot of — there’s a huge traction in the U.S. market as well in the oil and gas sector. So this bid book increase of 46% is a reflection of the pent-up demand in these three geographies.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vikash Singh — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Understood, sir, and sir, my second question basically pertains to, sir, what is the out of 1.1 million of total order book, what is the outstanding Indian order in terms of tonnage?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Yes. So right now, as I said, we have almost close to — we have close to almost like 400,000 tons of an order book in our U.S. entity. We have almost close to 250,000 tons of an order book in our India entity, and we have close to 475,000 tons of an order book in our Saudi entity. So that is the breakup of the 1.1 million.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vikash Singh — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Okay. Sir, coming to Saudi operation, that is the most strong order book geography right now. So just wanted to understand the incremental cash flow, which would be coming from executing those orders basically. What would be the utilization of the same?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","So first, I would say that, a, Saudi order book and U.S. order book both are very strong. Saudi is at 475,000 and the U.S. is equal to 400,000 to almost close to 400,000 tons. Both of them have a very strong order book, and thirdly, coming to the Indian order book, at 250,000, we are still in very active discussions for some new orders, and this will also significantly grow up in subsequent quarters. So that’s one.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Coming to the cash flow. As you know, we are a 35% stakeholder in our Saudi entity and still the largest shareholder. Whatever the earnings which will there in the proportionate, they will flow back as the dividends to us, and that is what we are estimating to come in FY 2023.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vikash Singh — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"So effectively, that money would come in the form of dividend to us. Understood, sir. Sir, just one last question. In terms of basically overall visibility side, you have talked to us in the U.S. that it’s very good etc. But then next year, usually, U.S. is going — U.S. would have an election, and we have seen the election usually would be a little bit weaker. So has U.S. already started getting any signs because we are already in the middle of the 2023, so just some thought process on that, whether it would be the similar pattern or this time, it could be different because of the energy needs requirement?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Vikash, we are seeing a little — we are seeing a fundamental shift in the U.S. situation at this point in time. It is like oil and gas, I think, has been clearly identified as a key priority area, irrespective of the political dispensation. Be it the Republicans, or be it the Democrats, they have all clearly understood that oil and gas is going to be the major mainstay. So earlier, as it used to make a significant impact during the election year, we are not anticipating any such thing in this — at least in this — in the coming years.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","And that is — that sort of account, that is also bringing a confidence with all the E&P and the midstream producers out there because it is not agnostic, whichever political dispensation is in place, and that is one of the reasons we are seeing a steady inflow of inquiries coming up from the U.S. So to your question that the election year — the next year election, is it going to slow down the whole process, we feel that it won’t make much of an impact.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vikash Singh — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Understood, sir, and sir, just on your views on the European demand, when we expect that region to start picking up on the pipeline’s order?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","See European demand will majorly now come in terms of the new energy businesses. There will be quite a few projects which will come up for carbon capture and hydrogen, and as you know that we have — as Welspun, we are aggressively working in terms of — that we are ahead in the curve in terms of our new energy businesses. So we will see that demand is coming up in the next two or three years’ time on the new energy side of it.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","As regards to oil and gas demand, I don’t — I think so it will be a muted demand because all the Russian gas is now completely supplemented by the U.S. supplies, and that is why we are seeing a huge traction of creating a gas pipeline infrastructure in U.S. so that they can pump in more and more gas and export more and more to the world.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vikash Singh — PhillipCapital — Analyst,Understood sir. Thank you for answering my question and all the best for future.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Thank you, Vikas.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Achal Bagaria [Phonetic] an Individual Investor. Please go ahead.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Achal Bagaria — Private Investor — Analyst,Hello? Am I audible?,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,"Yes, ma’am please proceed.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Achal Bagaria — Private Investor — Analyst,"Congratulations, sir, for a good set of numbers. Sir, can you — actually, this question was already asked. I just want to get some more insight on this. The EBITDA proportion segment-wise, if you could give — throw some light on that?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","I think so let’s stay to the consolidated EBITDA, and I think so a one-on-one interaction, we can have a little more detailed breakup around that. But for this call, let let’s keep it on an average EBITDA, please.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Achal Bagaria — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay, and sir, can you provide some insight on like what are our raw material sourcing strategies, etc, currently?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Raw materials, Yes, sure. As you know, on the line pipe business side of it, we are one of the largest line pipe producers in the world. We have a very robust supply chain and sourcing strategy in place. we are one of the top three players in the line pipe globally at this point in time, which means we play in an absolute niche segment of the line pipes where approvals and accreditation are extremely difficult. There are just one or two players in that particular segment in which we operate, and that also demands that our supply chain correspondingly has to be extremely robust, so which is — we have almost a sort of a relationship with just about every steel mill in the world, and we have done extensive business with them.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","So on the pipe side of it, our supply chain raw material sourcing strategy has been extremely robust, and that has been one of the key factors for our success in the past years. On the — coming on the other side of the business, which is the steel side of it — of the business, it is the sourcing of iron ore or sourcing of the coal, these are commodities, and we are now a large buyer of these commodities.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We are now an international buyer in these commodities. We have — they are absolutely established players in this particular field. These all commodities are index-based commodities. So we have also now — we started we are completely plunging to those, and we have now established a very, very efficient and a robust supply chain system of our iron ore and coal as well.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","On the scrap side of it, scrap is again a commodity. We are again buying scrap. That is the third raw material which we buy or the 4th raw material which we buy, and for that also, we have established sources from which we are sourcing the scrap. So on the raw material side of it, I think so we have laid a lot of emphasis. We have completely streamlined the process, and we have an absolute robust supply chain system now in place.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Achal Bagaria — Private Investor — Analyst,"And sir, just one last question. Like what is the market outlook pertaining to the steel side of the business, like the WML, WDI business, etc, what is the market outlook for the future that you are looking upon?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Yes. As I said earlier in my call, the business looks very promising. What it matters to us is the DI pipe business, and as you see, the Jal Jeevan Mission is going full go at this point in time. There is a huge pull in the — huge requirements across pan-India in this particular segment. I think so we are seeing a sustained growth for our next five to seven years’ time, and I think — so there’s a great demand, which is going to be there. It is — we will have to take our own share out of that particular demand, and we are very confident around that.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Achal Bagaria — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay, and sir, anything about WML on the Pig Iron side of the business?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Pig Iron is not a product which we want to sell. Our whole purpose of having WML is to supplement the DIP. Our focus is to ramp up our DIP and convert entire Hot Metal into DIP, right? But it is a process, it is a journey. It takes its own time, and you see on a quarter-on-quarter basis of what significant improvements have been made, and I’m sure that in subsequent quarters also, we will be absolutely ramping up to our fullest potential, right? So as our DIP business will continue to ramp up, our Pig Iron business, which is — it will continue to go down. We are not focused about Pig Iron, we are focused about DIP.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Achal Bagaria — Private Investor — Analyst,Okay sir. Thank you so much sir.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member",Thank you.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhishek Ghosh from DSP Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Ghosh — DSP Mutual Fund — Analyst,Yeah hi sir. Thanks for the opportunity. Am I audible?,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Yeah, Abhishek. Good morning.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Ghosh — DSP Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Thanks for the opportunity. Good morning. Just a few questions. I don’t know if maybe Percy can come here to just reconcile. I’m just looking at the cash flow statement, and if I see from the September balance sheet, you have reduced as far as the net debt is concerned, but there is a meaningful increase in the net working capital while you also generated some operating cash flow, but the entire increase in net working capital does not get offset by the own cash generation because the increase in inventory is far higher. So if you can just help me reconcile how has the net debt come down? Is it because of consolidation of Sintex assets? Or what is it, if you can just help me understand that?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Percy Birdy — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, Abhishek, this is Percy here. So net debt has come down indeed from — if you look at from the December quarter, which was about INR1,800 crores to now about INR1,100 crores in March ’23, and this is, of course, thanks to the strong EBITDA numbers also. So we had INR483 crores of EBITDA for this current quarter, and there has been some working capital unlocking also that has happened. So some of the export orders in from India, which have started getting executed.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Percy Birdy — Chief Financial Officer,"So there also, we have had some unlocking, and this unlocking will happen in the next fiscal year as well as we go forward. So I think it’s a mix of various things. Sintex acquisition also has been completed. You are right, and that has also turned out in a favorable way than what we had anticipated one year ago. So I think it’s a mix of all these things. EBITDA, unlocking our working capital and the acquisitions getting completed. All these have resulted in a reduction in our net debt. It’s a substantial reduction, almost INR700 crores in one quarter. So I think it’s a very good number that we have demonstrated.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Ghosh — DSP Mutual Fund — Analyst,So just one clarification. The inventory levels in December quarter were already at similar levels from that of March.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Percy Birdy — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, December was very similar to March. You’re right. If you compare with March ’22 versus March ’23, then yes, you will see there’s a substantial increase, but that’s, of course, various reasons we know. Our U.S. was hardly anything in March ’22, and most of the revival in U.S. has happened in this last three, four quarters. So that’s the reason.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Ghosh — DSP Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Okay. Okay, and just in terms of how much of consolidation of cash has happened because of Sintex coming into the business?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Percy Birdy — Chief Financial Officer,"So Sintex, as a company, they have cash on the balance sheet. Some of that cash, of course, will get utilized because the CIRP balances will get paid out. So that will come down. But otherwise, they have sufficient cash on the balance sheet to carry out their operations, business, their marketing, their brand spend, whatever is there, some balancing equipment that they need to arrange. So they have a very comfortable position as of now.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Ghosh — DSP Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Okay, and just in terms of the overall guidance that you have given about INR15,000 crores of top line on FY ’24 and if you look at the current net working capital, it is broadly at about INR4,200 crores, just to get an understanding for that INR15,000 crores of top line, what will be the net working capital requirement?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Percy Birdy — Chief Financial Officer,"So I think there is a substantial growth, 50% growth in the top line that we have guided from INR10,000 to INR15,000 crores, and you’re right that there will be some working capital also that will be required to fund this growth. But we have seen some of the numbers like inventory numbers as of March ’23, are also at a reasonably high level, and we will also see some unlocking of working capital happening. So I think on the whole, it will balance out, some of the old inventory will get unlocked, and depending on how we get new orders and how we are able to reinforce our order book, we might have to get in some more working capital infused as well. On the whole, I don’t think there’s any going to be a very major increase or decrease. We should be able to deliver decent sized free cash flows.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Ghosh — DSP Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Okay. Okay, and just one more thing on the overall domestic pipe business, there’s been a sharp increase in profitability, if one can help even going forward as this expectation of large amount of water orders coming through because also you have commissioned the new plant in Bhopal and other things. How — and typically, water projects are relatively lower margin business. So how should one look at the margin profile as far as the domestic business is concerned?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","I think it will — the domestic market — the domestic business is a blend of export and domestic, right? And this blend also includes execution in the oil and gas, execution in water, and third is the export. So it is a blend of these three things. So this blend keeps on changing. It is a project business at the end of the day, Abhishek. This blend keeps on changing on a quarter-on-quarter basis.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","In the last quarter, in this quarter, fourth quarter, it was extremely favorable. Moving forward, on a year-on-year basis, I think so it evens out. But on a quarter-on-quarter basis, it changes. So it’s very difficult to say that is the performance going to get repeated in the next — similar performance is going to get repeated in the next quarter, very difficult to answer because it is all dependent on the plan. I think a project company to that extent, will have a challenge like that, and probably rather than looking at quarter-on-quarter, let’s look on the year-on-year business, please.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Ghosh — DSP Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Exactly, sir. So on an annual basis, your product mix will largely whatever margin shift and one should look at it from that perspective.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member",Correct. Correct. Correct.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Ghosh — DSP Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Okay, sir, and just one last thing on the DI pipe perspective. You have seen a very good inflow over there. What’s the status in terms of stabilization of the unit, you’ve also broken in even as far as EBITDA is concerned, but any just current update in terms of how are the ramping up of the new plant is happening?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","No, it’s absolutely on track. It is absolutely on the expected line. I think, sir, we are very focused on the quality and serviceability apart from production, I think we are bucketing it into three zones and all the three buckets, which is production, quality and serviceability, I think, ramping up completely on the expected line. It’s a journey. It’s not going to happen overnight. We will — to reach our fullest potential, we would still need a couple of more quarters, but it is absolutely on expected line. Rather much better than what we had expected.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Abhishek Ghosh — DSP Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Okay, great sir. Thank you so much for answering my questions, and wish you all the best.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Thank you, Abhishek.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,The next question is from the line of Ankur Agarwal from RC Wealth Solutions Private Limited. Please go ahead.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Ankur Agarwal — RC Wealth Solutions — Analyst,"Congratulations sir for good set of numbers. My question is regard your target for INR15,000 crores top line [Foreign Speech]. In March quarter, you did INR4,000 crores and 12% [Indecipherable]. So that means your margin will reduce in coming year compared to the March quarter?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Ankur, good morning. I think so this is the broad guidance what we are giving at this point in time. It is just — it’s a reflection of the intent of the MAT. It is — do not read too much into that, that it will go down or go up. I think so it is — at the end of the day, it will be a quarter-on-quarter performance and the financial year performance, which will matter to us. But in terms of giving a guidance — guideline that how are we seeing what direction the business is going to move, it is just — it is only a reflection of that. So I think the let’s read to that extent only at this point in time.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We are hoping that it is our internal target to deliver better than this in any case that is what our endeavor would be and we are very hopeful around that because all the businesses, the pipe businesses or the steel, our DIP businesses or our WSSL business and our Sintex business, all the four businesses, as you see, are seeing a huge tailwind at this point in time, and to the extent we will be able to leverage it, these numbers will only improve from here. So I think so let’s leave it at the guidance level at this point in time, and let’s evaluate on, let’s say, half yearly and yearly basis, please.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Ankur Agarwal — RC Wealth Solutions — Analyst,How much capacity utilization it presents in pipe business?,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","The capacity utilization would be close to — our U.S. capacity utilization will be almost close to 80%, 85% or let’s say 100% because they have a confirmed order book for everything for the spiral mill. In our Saudi business, our capacity utilization is 100%. In our India business, our capacity utilization, average capacity utilization, because we have longitudinal mills, we have spinal mills, we have ERW mills, so I will say that our average capacity utilization will be close to 50% to 60%.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd

"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","No, no, this is not — this is excluding Saudi, number one, and of course, this is including the margins coming out of the scrap sales, yes.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Himesh Shah — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay. Okay, and. I just want to understand from the broad perspective of over the next two, three years, what will be your cash utilization look like? Because if you generating around INR1,000 crores of free cash flows every year, what will be the priority areas?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","See, we have always followed a very prudent capital allocation policy, right? We have — our focus has been very clear that, a, number one, we have to invest in our growth if we have cash. Number two, we have to create reserves; and number three, we have to reward our shareholders. I think so we are — these are our three pillars on which we always have utilized and, of course, delivered our balance sheets and all that stuff. So this is the broad framework under which we have always worked and we will continue to work in that particular framework. For us, all these four pillars are equally important.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Himesh Shah — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay, and one last question, now that you have many businesses under one umbrella. Will there — are you looking at any demerger in the medium-term, let’s say, the next three to five years of any of the businesses?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We are — at this point in time, we are only focused on growth. These are all new businesses, all startups with huge potential. We are — at this point in time, our fullest energy is dedicated in terms of growing these businesses. We are not exploring any other options at this point in time.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Himesh Shah — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay, and how much of your sales on the DI side will be to — will be from the group company, Welspun Enterprises?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Negligible because I don’t — it could be very negligible. I don’t think so that they are so active into this water distribution network. I think so they are more on the infrastructure side of it, roads and building and highways and — so they are doing something on the water, but I think from a sales perspective, will be very negligible. But anyway, whatever it will be, it will be completely on a unhinged [Phonetic] basis.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Himesh Shah — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay. Thank you so much sir, and all the best. Good set of numbers.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member",Thank you Himesh.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Saket Kapoor from Kapoor Company. Please go ahead.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,"Thank you for the opportunity. Coming again to the DI pipe of the story. Sorry, I missed your utilization numbers and your order booking for the segment, what are the quantities that we are going to execute for this year?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Saket, you’re talking about DI, right?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,Yes sir. DI pipe.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","As I said, we have an order book at this point in time of close to 140,000 tons of — in the DI business, and this is why it designed and I think so there is enormous potential to even increase this order book, but we are calibrating it with respect to our execution capability. As I said, we are working on three parameters. One is productivity, other is quality and third is serviceability. These are the three key fundamentals on which we are working on it, and we think that this order book reflects — is a very healthy order book at this point in time, one. Two, to increase the order book is going to be extremely easy. We can always do that, and at an appropriate time, we will again enter the market and increase it once we are — once our — the ramp-up which is happening at the right pace, we are able to accomplish our targets around that.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,"And sir, our capacity for the DI pipe is? what is the number?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","400,000 tons.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,"400,000 tons, correct sir, and with the lower coal and iron ore prices currently, do you think that there is a strong tailwind in terms of this DIP segment and wherein I think the realizations have also moved up, so if you could — hence, the EBITDA pattern from the DIP segment, there is an incremental chance of having — approaching higher margins. Is that understanding correct?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","That’s a fair understanding, but you have to see — you don’t have to see on a month-on-month basis, you have to see on a year-on-year basis. Because typically, what you have is a raw material inventory of two to three months. So at some point in time, you will have a higher price inventory and then now the commodity prices have slowed down — come down. Then you will buy a new inventory, which will be topped up by with a low price inventory, so the blend — you will be able to see the blend advantage over a year’s time. So — but yes, the reduction in the commodity prices on the year basis is going to definitely help.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,"Sir, in the Saudi part, what portion we have got from the new city of NEOM sir, any order booking we have done from there? And what is the pillar from that geography?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","We have booked a significant portion of our orders coming out of NEOM, and as you know, that our Saudi mill is the largest and the best producing mill in the KSA and like the same is the case in Saudi and the same is the case in India. But — and that is why we have the opportunity of servicing requirement under NEOM, there is a substantial requirement we are servicing at this point in time for that particular city.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,"Right, and lastly, sir, for the seamless segment in the — I think for the — do we have a presence in the seamless pipe and the premium thread business also?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","No, we are not in carbon steel seamless. We are stainless steel seamless and we do not have — we are not present into the thread segment. But having asked this question, I must say that this is a turnaround story of the group, a company which has been a perpetually loss-making company and this year, they have — they’re coming — they are absolutely EBITDA and cash-positive and with a very — extremely great future. They are doing extremely well.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,You are talking about the Welspun Specialty Steel?,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member",That’s right. I’m talking about Welspun Specialty Steel. I’m sure you have seen their financials.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,"Yes. Sir, I just go through them. Sir, lastly, on the share of profit and loss JV part. Percy sir, if you could…",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,"Mr. Kapoor, I’m sorry.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,"Ma’am, if I could just complete, with your permission.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,"Okay sir, please continue but this would be the last question.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,"Yes this is the last, I will join the queue. For the share of profit and loss from the joint venture and associates if you could give more color how is this going to shape up? And what are the key components of that? For the year, it is INR76 crores profit and for the quarter, it is INR29 crores.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","This share of profit is coming primarily from our Saudi entity. As you know, they have a robust order book, a very profitable order book, and I’m sure this is bound to increase as we executed.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Saket Kapoor — Kapoor and Company — Analyst,"Thank you, sir. And all the best sir. Thank you.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Thank you very much, Saket.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Vikash Singh from PhillipCapital. Please go ahead.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vikash Singh — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Thank you for the opportunity again. Sir, just a small clarification I need, the 250 KT order book generally [Phonetic] you’re saying, that is exclusive of that 140 KT of DI or it is inclusive?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Exclusive, we are talking pipe.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vikash Singh — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Yes, and sir, secondly, on a previous participant’s question, so is it that you have told us that the Sintex has closer to INR700 crores cash and consolidation of that would have brought down our debt or is different basically? Because net working capital still seems to be on a higher side. So that’s what we wanted to understand.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Percy Birdy — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. So Vikash, substantial of the cash, which was on the Sintex BAPL balance sheet has been utilized for payment of the consideration, the settlement of the lenders as well. Some part of the cash has been retained on Sintex balance sheet also because as we — as the business grows, as they rebuild the brand, they will obviously need some of the cash for the business purposes, their expansion and growth and working capital financing also. But the short answer to your question is majority of the cash has been utilized for settlement of the creditors.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vikash Singh — PhillipCapital — Analyst,Understood sir. Thank you.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member",Thanks Vikas.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vignesh Iyer from Sequent Investments. Please go ahead.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vignesh Iyer — Sequent Investments — Analyst,"Congratulations sir on a strong set of numbers. I just wanted to understand, would it be fair to say that the — I mean you are targeting a revenue of INR15,000 crores for the entire year. It will be more skewed towards H2 of the year considering the ramp up that is being done by the company?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Vignesh, you are right. I think I — see this will be more skewed towards Q3 and Q4. Because generally, if you see the KNL [Phonetic] project business, the Q1 is always a sort of a muted quarter, right? And then you start building up in Q2 and it reaches to its pinnacle around Q4. So that’s the way it happens, and it is across all the B2B businesses, we are not agnostic to that. So — but we are more than confident that we’ll hit this number.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vignesh Iyer — Sequent Investments — Analyst,"But even if we say that the Q1, Q2 is muted, on a Y-o-Y basis, we would be seeing a strong set of execution, right?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member",Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vignesh Iyer — Sequent Investments — Analyst,"Right. So sir, second question from my side would be on this. The associate company of yours, which is in Saudi, which has received an order of, if I’m not wrong, INR4,000 crores. what would be the execution time line of that order?",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","So this order will start getting — right now, they are already having some pending order books, which they are going to execute till September, and this new order will come into execution from September, then we’ll go to, let’s say, May or June to the next year.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Vignesh Iyer — Sequent Investments — Analyst,Okay. Sir I will get back in queue. Thank you sir.,WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Vipul Mathur, MD and CEO of Welspun Corp Limited for closing comments. Over to you, sir.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","Thank you very much, gentlemen, all of you for attending this call today. I think so we tried to give you as much as information possible to quell any doubts or any questions you may have. But still, if you think that anything is still left unanswered and you really want to, you are more than welcome to circle back to us and Salil and Gaurav and Mr. Percy will be more than happy to answer all of your questions.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","I just want to reiterate that this company is absolutely on the cusp of growth, all the businesses, the line pipe businesses, which is our mainstay, the steel businesses, the Sintex business and our WSSL businesses, all the businesses are poised to growth. I think so the performance of the last quarter is a complete testimony to that. The market pool is there, the demand is there, and I’m sure all the operating parameters and processes are in place. The complete leadership team is in place. The complete bandwidth is available, so — and we are seeing also a tapering of the commodity cycle, which should help. All these factors put together, I think, so it’s putting the company into a good position.",WELCORP,Welspun Corp Ltd 
"Vipul Mathur — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Board Member","And you will see — you will continue to see superlative performance moving forward in the subsequent quarters, and we will come back to you on a quarter-on-quarter basis to give you an update around that. but — and we are very optimistic and confident to the guidance what we have given this time to the market, and we look forward for your continued support.

Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to the V-Guard Industries Limited Q4 FY ’23 Results Conference Call, hosted by PhillipCapital India Private Limited. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,I now hand the conference over to Mr. Deepak Agarwal from PhillipCapital India Private Limited. Thank you. And over to you sir.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Deepak Agarwal — Analyst,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Deepak Agarwal — Analyst,"On behalf of PhillipCapital India Private Limited, I welcome you all to V-Guard Industries Limited Q4 and Full-Year FY ’23 Earnings Conference Call. Today, we have with us senior management represented by Mr. Mithun Chittilappilly, Managing Director; Mr. Ramachandran V, Director and COO, and Mr. Sudarshan Kasturi, Senior VP and CFO.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Deepak Agarwal — Analyst,"Without taking much of time, I would like to hand over the floor to the management for their opening remarks, post which we’ll open the floor for Q&A.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Deepak Agarwal — Analyst,"Thank you. And over to you, sir. Thanks.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Thank you, Deepak, and PhillipCapital for hosting this call for us.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"A very warm welcome to everyone present on today’s call. Thank you for joining us today to discuss the operating and financial performance of our company for the fourth quarter and the full year of FY ’23. I trust all of you have had a chance to refer to our Investor Presentation, which was shared yesterday.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"We reported consolidated net revenues of INR4,126 crores in FY ’23, which is higher by 17.9% on a Y-o-Y basis. Excluding revenues from Sunflame, the underlying revenue growth is 16.3% on a Y-o-Y basis, ahead of the CAGR of 11.9% over the period from FY ’19 to FY ’23.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"During the year, the South markets grew by 9% y-o-y, while the non-South markets grew by 26.4% Y-o-Y. With continued strong growth from non-South markets, their contribution to overall revenues has crossed 45%, providing the business with a diversified revenue base.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"In our Electronics segment, comprising of stabilizers, digital UPS and inverters, we reported revenue growth of 21.9% Y-o-Y. In the Consumer Durables segment, where we market fans, water heaters, kitchen appliances and air coolers, we registered a growth of 20% Y-o-Y. The Consumer Durables segment is achieving meaningful scale in top line, and we are sure that the benefits of operating leverage will soon become visible going ahead.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"In the Electricals segment, comprising of wires, pumps, switchgears and modular switches, we registered a growth of about 11% Y-o-Y. FY ’23 has been a difficult year in terms of margins for our industry. After a few challenging quarters caused by significant input cost challenges, Q4 margins have shown an improvement over the previous quarter. The benefit of stable commodity prices and the charge out of high-cost inventory are beginning to flow through. We expect the gross margins to further improve in Q1 FY ’24.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"In Q4 FY ’23, we have taken a P&L charge of about INR10 crores towards one-time expenses relating to the acquisition of Sunflame and Simon Electric. The advertisement and promotion spends are also higher as they are steadily returning to the normative levels. PAT in FY ’23 is INR183 crores compared to PAT of INR228 crores in FY ’22. It is pertinent to note that in FY ’22, we had a prior year tax credit of INR8 crores as we switched over to the new tax regime.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"In FY ’23, the tax benefit of about INR20 crores arising from the Simon merger has been shown under the other comprehensive income. Adjusting for that one-time expense incurred in FY ’23 and the tax benefit in the base year, the profit after tax is fairly similar level in FY ’22. As we had indicated earlier, we are carrying higher inventories to mitigate risk of supply disruption and would like to revert to normative inventory levels over FY ’23. We have made substantial progress in doing so, and we have released close to INR200 crores worth of working capital with the scope of another INR70 crores to INR80 crores to be released in the following quarters.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"During Q4 FY ’23, we completed the acquisition of Sunflame and the merger of Simon. In the case of Sunflame, the initial post-transaction work is complete and the business integration is underway. Hiring for key positions is complete and dealership is now in place for Sunflame. Over the next six months to nine months, we will review the portfolio, strengthen channel presence and undertake interventions in technology and process capabilities.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"The Simon merger has been completed with effect from 25th of March 2003. We have started running the business, and have identified areas to focus on the near term. These M&As are all good strategic fit to V-Guard and with multiple levers for synergy benefits. The Board of Directors have recommended a final dividend of INR1.03 per equity share on a face value of INR1.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"With that, I conclude my opening remarks and would like to thank Deepak Agarwal and their team at PhillipCapital for hosting this call and would like to request the moderator to open the floor for Q&A. Thank you.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,Questions and Answers:,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Rahul Agarwal from InCred Capital. Please go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Hi. Good evening, good afternoon and thank you so much for the opportunity. Three questions. Firstly on South market. It’s been underperforming for V-Guard for the year for the quarter. What’s your reading, Mithun, on this? Is it more competition? Or is it anything else? Especially wires and durables for fourth quarter looks really low to me.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Okay. Yeah, the South market is fairly mature for us. We don’t have that much avenues of growth in terms of distribution expansion. So, most of the growth is organically coming and some of the growth is coming by way of introduction of new products. So with the kind of challenging environment as we saw in the last year with huge inflation and softening consumer demand, there has been — the growth of 9% is what we have achieved. But having said that, even traditionally pre-COVID South was growing at something like 8% to 9% and non-South was growing at something like 22%, and that’s how the average was coming to around 15%. So, we’re doing okay with the South market growth of 9%. It’s not very high, but it’s probably reflective of the fact that it’s a fairly mature market.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"And sorry, the second question is?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"No, second question essentially was a reflection of fourth quarter performance also that whilst durables’ top line look pretty low to me, but the more important question here is that since you said in South, we cannot expand distribution more. So, this performance of 9% Y-o-Y, maybe 15%, 20% non-South, does that continue next year? That’s more important to understand.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yeah. I think this was the — of course, as we grow larger in non-South, the base is getting large, but we still have some white spaces even in non-South. So, we are probably only still present in the larger towns and cities in non-South. We’ve not really explored the upcountry markets much because we are building a new brand. So, we still have lot of levers in non-South to grow. And if you ask me non-South market is actually roughly 60% of the total India market and about 35% to 40% is the Southern part of the country. So in that sense, we still have some more way to go in terms of distribution expansion.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Perfect. Got it. Secondly, on Sunflame, in your press release, you have given consol P&L as well as the ex-Sunflame P&L. I’m just trying to remove the EBITDA difference, that’s INR10 crores. Obviously, there is a one-off sitting there, which is INR10 crores, which is including other expense. Is that correct, Sudarshan?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,"So, you’re trying to work out Sunflame EBITDA? Is it? That was INR8 crores for the quarter. That’s the difference.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"But the EBIT reported is INR14 crores. So, I was bit confused how is that?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,"No, the Sunflame — we will check that. But what I remember saying was Sunflame revenue…",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,Sunflame revenue was about INR57 crores something and EBITDA was INR14 crores [Phonetic].,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,Yeah.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,The other INR10 crores what you mentioned is one-off is in the V-Guard costs.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,It’s sitting in other expenses of V-Guard.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,Okay. So maybe I’ll repeat my question. What I meant is Sunflame difference is INR57 crores on revenue. The EBIT reported in Sunflame is INR8 crores. Is that correct?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,Yes. Correct.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,Can I get the EBITDA number for Sunflame?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,Just give me a moment. I will tell you.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,We will come back on that.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,We will come back on that.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,We will connect offline on this number.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Okay. And just last question on the debt side. So, my understanding was we had INR400 crores cash, and we were drawing about INR300 crores for the acquisition. When I see the balance sheet right now, it has INR270 crores long term, which I understand is more for Sunflame. But why do we have INR150 crores short term? I just need to get a clarification on that. That’s all. That’s my last question.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. No, we took a funding mix like that. We took a long-term funding of INR275 crores and then the short-term is like vendor financing, which is a working capital facility. So, that was the funding which we used.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So V-Guard was not using its working capital facility. And we decided to use a mixture of the working capital facilities to a smaller degree and, of course, long term deck for a larger degree. So it gives us some flexibility to keep the debt down as we go forward.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,Got it. Perfect. Thank you so much. All the best for the year. I will come back in queue.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Sonali Salgaonkar from Jefferies. Please go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sonali Salgaonkar — Jefferies — Analyst,"Sir, thank you for the opportunity. Sir, my first question is again regarding Sunflame integration. You did speak about that a little bit in your opening remarks. But could you throw some more color as to what are the key steps of integration that you propose to take, both in terms of back-end integration as well as front-end integration? And also, if you could share any milestone revenue or cost synergies that you propose to get out of this integration?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Okay. Ram, you want to take this?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah, Mithun. I’ll do that. I think Sunflame is going to continue as a standalone entity operationally, and it will run independent of V-Guard, so that the two brands are able to compete. I think they also have the different advantages in terms of cost structure and go-to-market. So, I think at this stage, we are keeping these two separate. So that’s the first part.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"I think in terms of how we will try to create benefit and impact on Sunflame, I think some of our central capabilities like maybe trade, procurement like, for example, if you may talk about customer service, so these are areas where we will be bringing our capability and know-how to benefit the Sunflame business. As far as — so I think that was your question, right? So, there is no direct integration between Sunflame and Simon, right — sorry, Sunflame and V-Guard, yes. We are going to operate separately.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sonali Salgaonkar — Jefferies — Analyst,"Right. But in terms of, say, production, so V-Guard outsources, if I’m correct, about 50% of the production.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"No, no. So as far as kitchen is concerned, again, I think in the short term, they continue to run as separate entities. V-Guard is setting up its own manufacturing facility, which is underway in Vapi. And that’s, fundamentally, we are looking at the gas stove and mixer grinders. At this stage, immediately, we don’t have any plans to shift our sourcing of gas stoves to Sunflame. But these are things that we will see because we are putting our capacity in place independent of Sunflame.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sonali Salgaonkar — Jefferies — Analyst,I understand. And what is the capex guidance for FY’24?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,Sudarshan?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,Capex will be around INR100 crores.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sonali Salgaonkar — Jefferies — Analyst,"I understand. And any cost or revenue synergies you would like to quantify that you propose to get from Sunflame, say, in your one-off integration or your two-off integration?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"I think at this moment, we won’t like to quantify anything. But yes, there are going to be synergies in sourcing, freight, packaging, stuff like that. And there may be even synergies by sourcing through Sunflame vendors for V-Guard as well, especially for gas stove and chimneys. So, these are things. At the moment, we are not going to quantify it. But I think for us, the low-hanging fruits for Sunflame will be — Sunflame today has very little presence in e-commerce, which is usually about 25% to 40% of the kitchen business in India today and Sunflame has very little presence in modern trade. Again, maybe 20% of the business in India today. So barring GT, we will be aggressively driving the other channels for Sunflame. Sunflame is very strong in canteen and GT, but the other two channels is missing from its portfolio. So, our focus will be on driving revenue growth for Sunflame first and then working on cost reduction.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sonali Salgaonkar — Jefferies — Analyst,"I understand. Second part of the question, Mithun, is also about the distribution network. Are there any advantages in terms of cross-selling that you perceive because Sunflame is moving on South? And also, if you could quantify what is the distribution of the retailer footprint of Sunflame versus V-Guard?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yeah. So Sunflame follows a slightly different distribution strategy. Sunflame works with super stockists, super distributors. So in each state, they have one or two or in some cases, three very large distributors, where Sunflame sells its products on a cash-and-carry basis and the distributor then stores and gives credit to the retailers in GT and then they have their own sales people on the ground selling it. So it’s a very different system from vis-a-vis mode, working directly with retailers, and we have a very large sales force and we have lot of smaller sized distributors. So that’s slightly different. So immediately, we are not looking to change much.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"But yes, in South India, Sunflame’s presence is very low. They get only 15% to 18% of the revenues from South India. So, we are aggressively going to grow the Sunflame business in South. Now, we are in the process of hiring people for Sunflame in South. They have a very small team, and we will be aggressively driving that. Right now, we are not looking to change the way Sunflame is doing its GTM. There are advantages to the way they’re doing it. And also, there are some disadvantages. But at the moment, we are not looking to change it. But at some point in the future, yes, we will try to see what is the best way to reach customers of Sunflame, whether we should follow their old selling strategy or move more in line with V-Guard’s GT?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sonali Salgaonkar — Jefferies — Analyst,Sure. And just one last question from my side regarding the core V-Guard business. Is there any pricing action that you have taken in Q4 or Q1 up until now? And how do you see the demand scenario and the channel inventory? That’s it from that side?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So, there has been a reduction in commodity prices as we move from Q3 to Q4, and we are also seeing further reduction in commodity prices as we move from Q4 to Q1 of this year. So, this means that this kind of is not required that we need to take any more pricing action. I think if the pricing remains stable and the raw material prices are still where they are, we should, in fact, slowly in the next four months back to the pre-COVID levels of gross margin. So it does mean that we have finished that super cycle inflation of commodities and we are back to where it was probably pre-COVID.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sonali Salgaonkar — Jefferies — Analyst,And demand and channel inventory?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Demand is weak. As you can see from our numbers and probably our peers, the demand has slowed down quite a bit in the country. I think the all-round inflation of food, fuel, everything has taken a toll on consumer sentiment and demand. And of course, the constant increase in interest rates also has put some spook in terms of ability for retailers to borrow and all that. Basically, lot of tightening has gone down. So retailers are also not stocking like they used to before this whole thing started.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"But we think that maybe Q2 onwards, we should start to see some revival in demand because now fuel prices have come off. We are seeing prices of a lot of the other items have also come down. So, I think once — we are hoping that with this kind of reduction in inflation, hopefully, we will probably enter the reduction in interest rate cycle, which should fuel demand. And I think that sometime mid of next year that — this year just should happen.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sonali Salgaonkar — Jefferies — Analyst,Sure. Thank you.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Thank you. We have the next question from Mr. Achal Lohade from JM Financial. Please go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you for the opportunity. Can you hear me, sir?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,Yes.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Okay. Sir, the first question is with respect to Sunflame. Is it right understanding that earlier we were talking about acquiring this business and being part of the standalone and now we are talking about running the other independent business, is that understanding right?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes. So, yes, Ram can go over that.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah. Sorry, if I understood your question correctly, you were wondering whether earlier our intent was to merge it and now we are running it separately. Is that what you’re saying?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,Yes. Yes.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"No, no, that’s not correct. I think that — the reason that we are running this independently is, fundamentally, each business system has its advantages, right? And therefore, we are keeping them apart, right? The cost structure and the GTM of the two businesses are very different, okay? And that’s the reason why, at least in the near to midterm, right, they don’t run as separate entities because there is a risk that there will be dilution in focus for Sunflame, right? So, we would like to focus and grow the Sunflame business.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"As Mithun said, we believe there is a fantastic opportunity to grow the Sunflame business. I mean, it’s an extremely reputed and well-known brand with very, very high top-of-mind awareness and recall in the kitchen category. And there are very strong growth levers like South, like modern trade, like e-commerce. And our focus is — I mean, we think that the value that we can create, right, by focusing on Sunflame is far more than integrating it because integrating it will certainly bring efficiencies, but I think the focus and the ability to grow the business will get impacted. That’s the reason why we’re going to run these two separately initially, right? So, we also have our own kitchen business, and we need to figure how we are going play the two brand architecture to grow more aggressively in the kitchen business.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"So, I think it’s fair enough to say that it was never our intent that we will immediately merge that business into V-Guard. It was always our intent that we would like to run these two businesses separately, so that we can focus parallelly. Because what has also been happening is lot of work has happened within V-Guard on the V-Guard kitchen business. As you can see that, we have set up our own manufacturing facility, and we have our own growth plans for, as you know, with all inorganic, right, until it is done, there is always uncertainty, right? So, we had our own plans for the growth of the V-Guard business, and we’ve made investments for the growth of V-Guard business, right? And bringing them together is not — is detrimental to the growth of both these, right?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Understood. The second question I had, sir, is it possible for FY ’23 as a whole, if you could give some strategy in terms of the growth in stabilizers, inverters, cables and wires, switches, etc? You may not give the mix, but at least the growth, if it is [Technical Issues] of Q4?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So, we don’t give out the product wise numbers, but I can tell you the stabilizer business has recorded a pretty strong growth, and that’s been primarily responsible for driving the growth in Electronics. And the inverters are okay. I mean, like the wire business has done a decent job. It was pretty good in the first 6 months, but last six months, the growth has slowed down because of reduction in copper prices and destocking by retailers. So that’s the broad color I can give on the various segments.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"And of course, Consumer Durables, as you know, is the segment with most number of new product categories. So it’s on a low base, growing fast, but of course, margins are a concern. And I think we are able to see some significant improvement in margins in CD even in this quarter and going forward because the margins in both water heaters and fans was impacted in this commodity cycle. And fans, at least we are able to see good improvement in margins going forward. And I think once the water heater season starts, I think there also we’ll start to see improvement in margins as we consume the new lower costs RMs.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Understood. Any broad number you would talk about in terms of the growth for FY ’24? Would that be in double digit, high single digit? Any color given the [Technical Issues]?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So, we are hoping that we can grow by 14% to 16% in the coming year, that is FY ’24.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"This is including Sunflame you’re talking, right, which has a….",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"No, no. This is without Sunflame. Sunflame will be an additional number.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Right. And within this 14% to 16%, what will drive, if you could give some more clarity on that, sir?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So what we can see is the Electronics segment will continue to grow well. I mean, we have had a good start to the year. Last year, we did not have a very good Q1 for electronics, and that impacted at least 6 months growth for Electronics. So electronics segment, it’s rebounding back to its pre-COVID kind of growth. And yes, I think it will have like the CD will grow at a high level and followed by Electronics and then Electricals. So that’s obviously the growth there.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,"Sir, the current participant seems to have dropped from the queue. We will proceed with the next question, which will be from the line of Natasha Jain from Nirmal Bang. Please go ahead.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Natasha Jain — Nirmal Bang — Analyst,Yeah. Hi. Can you hear me?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,Yes. Go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Natasha Jain — Nirmal Bang — Analyst,"Yeah. Hi, sir. Sir, in the Electronics segment, your revenue growth, I am seeing it on a Q-on-Q basis, it has increased sharply. But vis-a-vis, if you see the margins there, that has not really improved. So can you just throw some color on that as to what is not really driving the margins there? Is it battery?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"No. So in the Electronics segment, there is two large categories, that is the stabilizer business and the inverter business. What happens is in every quarter, the product mix is different. So in Q1 and Q4, we sold lot of air conditioners, stabilizers and inverters and batteries, whereas in Q2 and Q3, it’s mainly the refrigerator and television stabilizer and to a lower extent inverters because it’s off-season for inverters. So the margins for the non-air conditioner stabilizers are fairly high, and that’s why the margins are looking good for Q2 and Q1 — Q2 and Q3 for Electronics. So that’s — so the better way to comparison will be — because product mixes are different in different quarters. So maybe it’s better to compare them Y-o-Y basis in terms of margins.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Natasha Jain — Nirmal Bang — Analyst,"Understood, sir. And second question I had was particularly in the battery segment. So sir, in quarter three, the lead prices have increased sharply and we weren’t able to pass on the price. But now in quarter four, we’ve seen that the prices for lead has kind of softened. So sir, can you just throw some color on that as well as to how the inventory is? Do we have high-priced inventory? Or how are we moving there?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So battery is a perishable product. So, we don’t carry much inventory in batteries because it’s got a finite shelf life. So typically, in the case of batteries, we try to work with us low inventory as possible. Having said that, if you ask me whether the margins are — so batteries are out of the woods? Not yet. But maybe we’re getting there. But in Q4, definitely, the battery margins were still less.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Natasha Jain — Nirmal Bang — Analyst,"All right. And sir, last question. So where are we in terms of manufacturing our own chimney versus importing? So have we ramped up the manufacturing facility in quarter four?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So in the case of V-Guard, particularly V-Guard is moving its chimney procurement from China to domestic vendors. V-Guard is not planning to set up a manufacturing for chimney. However, Sunflame is manufacturing chimneys in India. So Sunflame — in case of Sunflame, yes, we are seeing some improvement in margins because they have moved from importing to making chimneys in their new manufacturing facility in Faridabad. So in the case of Sunflame, that is happening. At some point in the future, when the manufacturing systems in Sunflame has stabilized, we will see the possibility of supplying chimneys to V-Guard as well. But at the moment, they are concentrating on only supplying for Sunflame brand.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Natasha Jain — Nirmal Bang — Analyst,"Understood, sir. Sir, that is all from my side. Thank you.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Aniruddha Joshi from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Aniruddha Joshi — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"Yeah. Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, one question regarding the demand outlook has considerably slowed down. So what is our internal thought process? When do we see the demand recovering back? Any number that you can see maybe two quarters, three quarters? And again, what are the three key important things that V-Guard is doing to, in a way, increase the demand? Also, can you indicate any market share gains or losses in past one year in the major categories of V-Guard as well as Sunflame? Yes. That’s it from my side. Thank you.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Okay. So yeah, the demand continues to be certainly weak. But having said that, there was decent sales for stabilizers in March and April. However, after that, we have had some unseasonal rains and it slightly impacted. But I think, overall, we are still hoping to do a decent Q1 for summer products. The demand for fans is still little bit subdued because of the changeovers in new star rating regime, and the fact that the channel is still sitting with inventory of older models, which was pushed out by all the brands in Q2 and Q3. So, that’s continuing to be slightly a drag on the overall fan demand. In terms of what we are doing is, we are constantly working on launching new products. So, we are having some launches for fans in the upcoming quarters, which we think will have some good, positive impact on demand. We are also going to have some launches on water heaters in the upcoming season.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So, I think the — some of the product launches that is going to happen will have some positive impact on product demand. And I think the good news is the inflation has peaked. It has started to come down, at least for the last four months, and it is continuing to. As there is going to be reduction in prices of all commodities, including food and non-food and fuel and everything, we hope that the confidence will come back for consumers to start again to spend money. So, I think that’s probably going to happen in mid of the current financial year. And that’s somewhere in the festive season we are expecting to see some revival in demand, and that’s what we see.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Aniruddha Joshi — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"Sure. Sir, and the key market share?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Okay. So, we don’t give out any market share numbers. But I can say that in the last two years to three years, V-Guard has gained some market share in fans probably and we have also gained some market share in water heaters. We also had a very low presence in e-commerce business, and we have also probably started to add some market share in the e-commerce side, where traditionally V-Guard was probably a late entrant and a slow mover.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Aniruddha Joshi — ICICI Securities — Analyst,"Okay. Sure, sir. Thank you. Very helpful.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Mr. Achal Lohade from JM Financial. Please go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,Yes. Thank you for the follow-up. I got disconnected earlier. [Technical Issues],VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,"Sir, sorry to interrupt, but the volume for you on your line is very low. We request you to please use the handset and speak closer to the mic.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,Is it better now?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Yes. This is much better.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Yeah. Thanks. What I wanted to understand is in terms of the distribution, where are we, what kind of growth are we looking at in terms of number of dealers and retailers? If you could also quantify, as of March, what is the retail and the dealer count?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Okay. Ram, you want to take this?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah. I think we have traditionally been growing our retail base annually by between 5,000 to 10,000 — sorry, 5% to 10%. So typically adding between 3,000 to 5,000 retailers every year, right? And we are very much on course with that kind of a growth [Phonetic].",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,If you could help us with the current statistics?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"I will give you a precise number. Maybe we’ll share offline. But it should be in the region of 50,000 to 60,000, right, which should be our current base, right? That’s why I said 5% to 10% and 3,000 to 5,000.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Right. I’m sorry. I missed out in the earlier question. Did you also give some clarity on — in terms of the Sunflame, how — what kind of revenues can one look at, given this is the first full year of operation?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,You are asking about Sunflame?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Yeah. Now, I’m asking for Sunflame.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So Sunflame, we are expecting to do close to INR400 crores to INR425 crores, somewhere in between that in the current year, hopefully.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"And the margin what we had in fourth quarter, sir — Sudarshan sir, have you given the EBITDA number like for Sunflame for — or the EBIT number?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,The EBITDA number for Sunflame is INR9 crores. The details are given in the presentation we circulated last night.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,Okay.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So Sunflame will do between 12% to 13% EBITDA, because we are also going to invest a lot of the moneys backed into A&P and strengthen the brand, and a lot of the other investments will go in. So maybe the Q4 EBITDA is looking a little high because there is not much activity in terms of A&P and all that in Q4. But in this year, we will be starting to spend again.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Understood. And just one more question with respect to the competitive intensity. I remember in the earlier calls, you have talked about the competitive intensity being way too high in Southern market for some of these categories like wires and water heaters and all given our presence. So if you could talk about how the current scenario is? Are you seeing the intensity is broad-based across the pockets, same intensity? Or is it kind of moderating?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So Ram, you want to take this?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah. Sure. I think see, in general, I think the growth outlook has been weaker for quite some time now, I mean, over the last few years. And that’s kind of triggered hypercompetition [Phonetic] as every company has got into adjacencies. Yes. So, I think these forces are very much there. We are seeing some broad contours of consolidation because I think continuous years of, what I would say, attempting to break in and not having a healthy outcome is showing in some instances. And I think companies are looking at how to organize towards that objective. But I think, for now, I think the competitive environment stays, what I would say, it continues to stay aggressive. Yes.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"But I think we should see some elements of sense maybe in a year or two, maybe 12 months to 18 months off the line. I think — see, all incumbents are trying to hold ground, right? So there is not much scope for — in an environment like today where growth has been significantly lower, right, for the market in the industry compared to historical growth rates with equivalent growth rates. So, I think companies will — companies are holding on to that position, right? And that’s kind of making it difficult to move forward through strategies, which are hypercompetitive in nature. So, I think we should see things getting better, but right now, thing will continue to seem okay.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Understood. And impact on the margins? Like earlier, you had put a 100 bps margin improvement, gross margin improvement every year. So just wanted to understand if that stays.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,"I think, I mean our primary task this year is to get back to the range what the gross margins were originally. So while in Q4, there is some improvement, some more has to come. We have to first get to where we were and then improve from there.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Achal Lohade — JM Financial Institutional Securities — Analyst,"Okay. Great, sir. Thank you so much.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Swati Jhunjhunwala from BOB Capital. Please go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Swati Jhunjhunwala — BOB Capital Markets Limited — Analyst,"Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Just one question on the ad spend. So, you ended this year with ad spend of around 2.1% and normalized ad spends are around 4.5%, if you see pre-COVID level. So do we expect this 2.1% to go to 4.5% [Technical Issues]? Or do we expect it to go to around 3%, 3.5%?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,"So historically, our ad spend is — hovers between 2.5% to 3.5%. When the times are tough and we are not able to spend, it has come down to 2.5%. And in a normal year, it’s gone to 3.5%. So, obviously, if our gross margins recovers to a pre-COVID level and the environment remains like I’m saying this kind of hypercompetitive activities are not too much there and the environment is conducive, yes, we will — we will probably move to 3% of revenue in the A&P and then progressively it will increase from there.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Swati Jhunjhunwala — BOB Capital Markets Limited — Analyst,"Got it. And when you say pre-COVID gross margins, that’s around 33%, if I’m not wrong?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes. Yes. Around 32% to 33% we used to do, yes.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Swati Jhunjhunwala — BOB Capital Markets Limited — Analyst,All right. Thanks.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Natasha Jain from Nirmal Bang. Please go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Natasha Jain — Nirmal Bang — Analyst,"Yeah. Hi, sir. Thank you for the follow-up question. Sir, could you just throw some light on the pumps business? The last time you had mentioned that the water level was good and therefore, the demand was subdued. So what’s happening in this quarter?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So the pump business had a very rough FY ’23. And we have noticed that most companies have had a similar tough time in terms of lack of growth and of course, which also means hypercompetition and lower-priced model launches, onslaught and all that. We are seeing some improvement in sales in May, which means that after a long time, it’s starting to grow. So, we’ll wait and see what happens. Even we have [Technical Issues] come off from their highs. We had very, very good rain. So water table remain very high throughout the year. Although I’m hoping that this year will be a little better. Having said that, we’ll wait and see. It’s still early days. But there are some indications that this year the pump business should do much better than what we did last year.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Natasha Jain — Nirmal Bang — Analyst,"All right. And sir, my next question is more on the broader macro side rather than very company-specific number. So sir, you’ve been continuously telling in your con calls that you want to protect your margins and you do not want to go to a price-cut strategy just to gain market share because that is not sustainable. And you say that everyone else can do it. So after a point, you stop to gain market share really. Sir, I want to know if you are protecting your margins at the cost of your top line, how quickly can you gain back the lost share? Because in this hypercompetitive market, I believe losing market share is more costly than protecting margins. So sir, what’s your take on that?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"No. I think what I — as a strategy, we try not to initiate price wars. But if some competitors wants to do it, we will match it and we will defend ourselves. For example, we have lost huge amounts of margins in our water heater business by simply trying to defend our market share. And then only defended — in fact, we have gained by some of the lost share over the last three years.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So it’s not that we are sitting idle and waiting for others to take our share. So that’s what Ram said that all the instruments [Phonetic] are holding on to their share and we are doing the same. So it’s not like we are letting anyone take any market share. What I meant to say that we will not initiate price wars or those kind of things to take. Probably, we will not start it. But if someone starts it, we will respond equally back.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Natasha Jain — Nirmal Bang — Analyst,"Got it, sir. Got it. Thank you. That’s all.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Rahul Agarwal from InCred Capital. Please go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Yeah. Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. Just two questions. Firstly, April, May, I’m getting feedback from the company that the weather has been funning [Phonetic] and rain has been there in North and West. We obviously saw the IPL final also disrupted. What’s your view in terms of non-South outperformance? How it has been?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes. So our numbers in South and East have been pretty good, and North and West has been subdued for summer products. And that’s whatever you have heard and whatever we’ve been reading is correct. North and West practically did not have much of a summer where every fourth day or fifth day, there was rains and so it has been funning. But having said that, Eastern markets and Southern markets have done well, where there was pretty warm weather. Again, this is not across. It’s state specific. So, we have had some mix of good summer and not so warm summer across.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"So does that impact our Electronics because I think AC is quite a large business for us? My sense is AC secondary sales are pretty weak versus primary. You would have seen any issues there or maybe fans, how that’s been?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So fan is continuing to be slow for a bunch of other reasons apart from weather, like the higher level of inventory of old models sitting in the channel because of people, other brands flushing out all the old inventory in Q3. That’s continuing to take some impact because the working capital of all the retailers are blocked with the old inventory. So, I think that sell-out [Phonetic], that’s going to be a challenge.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"In the case of air conditioner stabilizers, we’ve had a good start to the year in the month of April, but May has been very weak. So we’ll wait and see. It’s not yet over. We still have one more. At least June 15th in North, there is — there used to be summer. So we’ll wait and see. But it’s not been — we have not had — we have had a decent performance by the stabilizers division in April, May.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Got it. And lastly on Sunflame. So, I got the fourth quarter EBITDA. What I wanted to ask is for full-year fiscal ’23, could you share revenue, EBITDA and PAT for the company for Sunflame?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,The previous periods don’t belong to us. So no [Speech Overlap],VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,Yeah. I understand. I understand that. I just need the base.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Sudarshan Kasturi — Chief Financial Officer,We won’t be able to give you the previous — the full-year number. The two and a half months is what we consolidate.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Okay, sir. No problem. Thank you so much.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Keyur from ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. Please go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Keyur Pandya — ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited — Analyst,"Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, just want to understand, if I’m not wrong, you mentioned about 15%, kind of 15%, 16% kind of growth for the next full year. So looking at these demand challenges, what will drive this growth, particular products or particular geography? And basically, will it be back-ended since near-term demand challenges are there? So if you can just dissect this 15%, 16% kind of growth number.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes. So that’s the kind of target we set ourselves when we had our Annual Planning Meeting, Annual AOP in the month of March. But we have also assumed that we will have a pretty normal summer. So some part of the growth could get impacted. Yes, the demand environment is a bit weak. Summer has not been very robust. It’s been okay in some places. It’s not been okay in some places. So yes, there is a chance that some of this growth will also come in the last four months, five months as we prepare for the next year summer.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So yes — so, I think we will try to grow 14% to 15%. But yes, there are some challenges through what we see in terms of bad weather and demand, both constricting our ability to grow in the first five months, five months. But I think, going forward, like I said, we are expecting the effect of inflation is kind of wearing down and as people have more money in their hands because the fuel, food and other inflations are coming down. We are hopeful that consumers will be coming back again.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Keyur Pandya — ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited — Analyst,"Okay. Our second question on the fan side. You mentioned about the higher inventory because of stocking, because of the rating change. So now, I mean, we have always considered fan as more of, say, necessary than discretionary. So this issue is because of the higher stocking because there are challenges at the secondary sales also. If you can just throw some light on that.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"I think, see, what happened is we had abnormal sale in Q3. I think most companies have had reported very good sales growth in Q3. Even we — we actually ran out of inventory by October end or something like that. We actually did not have inventory to sell for the old models. So, I think whichever company had a lot of stock of the old model, they just gave whatever kind of discount they wanted and then sold them in the market. Also, there is a price increase from the old model to the new model. So the retailers were very enthused with the delta of buying something at potentially a 20%, 25% discount from what the new model will look like in January. So, that has enthused a lot of these guys to stock up on these products, and that’s what’s creating the slowness in the market.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Keyur Pandya — ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited — Analyst,Consumer sales is happening or there is lull at that?,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Even there, I think the summer was not as strong, right? So even there, I think, at least in Northern West, the summer has been quite weak. Eastern markets and Southern — parts of South markets, summer has been good and we are seeing secondary liquidation. So the secondary liquidation has not happened, also to the extent that it could have happened in Northern West. So that also is going to play a — delay the demand for fans, yes, humans.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Keyur Pandya — ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited — Analyst,"Okay. Understood, sir. Just last one question. So on the Sunflame side, so as you mentioned that V-Guard has kitchen appliances portfolio so has Sunflame. So any timeline on how — any broad thought we would have definitely given before acquiring the company that how we’ll navigate through this? So I mean, what is the medium-term plan for both of these brands and it will be geography-specific? Or do you layer it one over the other? So what is the thought over medium term?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"Yes. Ram, you want to take this?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. I think, at this point in time, we would not like to outline in more detail. I think we are also doing some work because we need to get into the company and the brand and understand the business and the brand and its customer base better, right? So, we are in that stage of the journey. It has been — we will be playing a two brand strategy. So it’s not like it’s one or the other, right? It will be V-Guard and Sunflame. The contours of how we are going to play this, I think that’s something that we are in the course of exploring and discovering, right?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Ramachandran Venkataraman — Director and Chief Operating Officer,"So, I think that is work in progress. I think whenever that we would be in a shape to share, I’m sure we will share. But at this stage, I think we are still in the discovery phase, right? I think mostly, we’ve been focused on taking control of the operation. It was a promoter-driven business side. And taking control has been the primary focus for us in the first six months. And then we will move forward towards, what I would say, how do we compete and how do we grow the combined franchise, right? But yes, I think what we are clear about is what brands are going to coexist and that we will have a strategy and approach that will allow both brands to, what I would say, play in the marketplace, focusing on different consumer segments, right? So that’s going to be our approach. Yes.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Keyur Pandya — ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited — Analyst,"Sir, thanks a lot and all the best to the team. Thank you.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,Yeah. Thanks a lot.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Natasha Jain from Nirmal Bang. Please go ahead.,VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Natasha Jain — Nirmal Bang — Analyst,"Yeah. Sir, my question is more of a follow-up on what the last participant had asked. So sir, in fans, what I understand is the market is very saturated and the demand is mostly a replacement demand, which is usually slower than the first-time demand. Now having that background in mind, just two days ago, Atomberg kind of raised good amount of money. Now understanding that their moat was BLDC, which is now replicated across players, so that moat goes away. So sir, then is it true to assume that there is still a very big market, which remains for fans? How do you see it in the long term?",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"No, fan is a very, very old product. It’s not a new category as such. So, you’re right in thinking and discovering that most of the demand is replacement. Of course, there is some new demand when our people build new houses, people build new apartments, buy new apartments and furnish it, fans will get sold. But a large part is replacement demand. What has been happening in the fan space and across broadly with Indian consumers is, as the value of the houses go up, as the amount of money people are spending into interiors is going up, we’ll be spending on interiors like decorative fans, premium interiors and all that. The average price of the fan is going up. So although the number of fans sold may not go up significantly, we believe the average price per fan will continue to go up and even BLDC is going to increase the prices by 20% to 30% per fan.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"So what will probably happen is the market growth for fans, lot of it will come from the value growth of fans. And today, some segment of people are spending money in terms of fans, but there’s still large part of the fans business is still [Phonetic] economy. So whilst what we believe in the next 10 years will happen, surely, the economy segment will reduce to probably, mainly institutions and those kind of customers buying in and then the retail customers are starting to spend more and surely [Phonetic] started to happen. So in the case of fan that is the case. We don’t comment on competitors and all these. But yes, Atomberg is a startup and they are running the business like a start-up. So once they — I mean, we would like to see every company in the business to run a profitable business.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Natasha Jain — Nirmal Bang — Analyst,"Understood, sir. Thank you.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing comments. Over to you, sir.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited 
Mithun Chittilappilly — Chairman and Managing Director,"I would like to thank Deepak Agarwal and PhillipCapital for hosting this call, and thank you all for your patient listening. That’s all from my side. Thank you.",VGUARD,V-Guard Industries Limited

S. Suresh — Managing Director,"On the global scenario, the global supply-and-demand has been virtually balanced as per the latest estimates released in April 2023, amidst supply concerns in both India and Brazil. Global sugar production for the current sugar year is slated to be lower than earlier estimates by 3 million metric tons at 177.4 million metric tons of course due to the concerns in Brazil and India, whereas the global demand is slated to increase by 0.23 million metric tons reaching 176.5 million metric tons.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
S. Suresh — Managing Director,"On Brazil, while crop condition is expected to be good, increase in gasoline taxes is incentivizing more diversion to ethanol and hence the sugar production is slated to be lower [Phonetic]. Risk of [Indecipherable] Q3 of 2023 impacting [Indecipherable] and Asian countries results in huge variability in 2023/’24 sugar balance projections. Having breached the [Indecipherable] $0.27 per pound in April 2023, the raw sugar futures are currently trading around $0.24 to $0.26 per pound.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
S. Suresh — Managing Director,"In India, because of the lower yield in key producing areas that is Maharashtra, the total production for the current year is slated to be lower than the previous year by almost 9%. Since erratic weather affecting yield in Maharashtra [Indecipherable] converged the estimates of sugar production during FY ’22/’23 to 328 lakh metric ton, down from previous estimates of 340 lakh metric ton. While international price is favorable for sugar exports, the government is unlikely to allow additional export quota given the supply restrictions in domestic market.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
S. Suresh — Managing Director,"Sugar diversion to ethanol in the current sugar year is slated to be 4 million metric tons, down from the earlier estimates of 4.5 million metric tons. It is encouraging to note that Tamil Nadu government as unveiled ethanol building policy 2023 covering grain-based and molasses based distilleries.

S. Suresh — Managing Director,"The performance of the standalone sugar division was better than the previous year on account of better sales realization and increased domestic sales volume. There was cost pressure on account of higher energy prices, which was partially offset by increased realization from power export. Overall, [Indecipherable] marginally increased during the year at — to 51.8 lakh metric tons from the earlier year number of [Indecipherable] in the previous year.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
S. Suresh — Managing Director,Overall sugar sales also increased from 4.95 lakh metric ton to 5.19 lakh metric ton. The company continues to deliver on its focus areas of sweating assets and expansion in core risk areas.

And the strategic benefits of all these expansions will flow from next financial year.,EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
S. Suresh — Managing Director,"Despite increase in interest rates are efficient cash management and cash — and cash generated from operations resulted in reduced finance cost of INR36 crores from the previous year number of INR46 crores.

I mean we have taken an impairment to the extent of about INR160 crores. This is based on the future projections of cash flow, were an independent valuer has carried out the valuation. And based on the valuation analysis there was an impairment that was required to be carried out. And number two is with reference to the joint-venture between EID Parry and Synthite, which is Algavista [Phonetic] on account of this joint-venture, we have taken an impairment to the extent of INR23 crores. This was on account of — this is again based on the cash flow projections, which has been carried out based on the future projections. Number three is with reference to the investment made in Alimtec, a Chilean company where we have taken an impairment to the extent of about INR26 crores. It was not economical for us to run this operations. So the management has taken a call, but as of March that we will not be able to run this operations and accordingly there is an impairment taken to the extent of INR26 crores.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
S. Suresh — Managing Director,"And these three put together is where the impairment is to the extent of INR155 crores. And there are projections, which have been made for the future based on which the impairment analysis has been carried out and we have recognized the same in the books of accounts. So we actually now would like — we would like to see that the operations generate the cash what is projected in the numbers and we’ll have to see how things shape up based on the projections what we have carried out.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
S. Suresh — Managing Director,"You asked about the question of whether there will be an reversion to the impairment. We have considered various projections in our financials based on the current estimates. We will have to — we are based on the estimates, were the impairment has been carried out. And at this moment, we would not be in a position to say whether there will be a reversal to the impairment, because there was a requirement of an impairment to be done is where we have considered that as of March. We will work towards to see how this impairment can be reversed, at least in the case of the refinery business and Algavista.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Karan Mehta — Nirzar Securities — Analyst,"Okay, okay. And sir my second question is we have mentioned that in our note that the parent company is willing to finance activities for subsidiary, Parry International DMCC. So how much more capital are we planning to infuse in this and in any other subsidiaries or JV?",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
S. Suresh — Managing Director,"Good afternoon, this is regarding Parry International DMCC. Parry International DMCC is basically trading company that is located in Dubai to serve the Middle-Eastern and the nearby markets. So this does not require much of a capital infusion, because it does trading on a back-to-back basis. Regarding other subsidiaries, Sridhar?",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
A. Sridhar — Chief Financial Officer,"As far as the other subsidiaries is concerned I mean, there is no capital infusion that has been projected as of now.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Karan Mehta — Nirzar Securities — Analyst,"Okay. And sir my last question pertains to our business segment, so the performance of our refining — refinery subsidiary has worsened in this quarter also we have seen an operating loss on the Nutra segment and in the distillery segment, we have seen above topline growth, but the margins have been declining very sharply. So what are the reasons for these and what’s the outlook for all these segments and in FY ’24?",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
A. Sridhar — Chief Financial Officer,"As far as the refinery is concerned, your question is pertaining to the fourth quarter operation. With respect to fourth quarter, our sales volumes were lower compared to our normal levels of the previous year fourth quarter level, that was one of the contributor and we expect this to be made-up in the current year in terms of the sales volume is concerned. Second is, we had to take some mark-to-market entries, as well as some forex losses on account of variation of the Indian rupee versus US dollar. We don’t expect this situation to continue, because these are related to the movement between the two currency pairs during the previous financial year and the outlook in the sense of refinery, which is basically based on three main pillars, one is with respect to availability of adequate spreads in the market. Second is, with respect to the cost of refining, which is largely driven by the fuel cost and third is with respect to cost of money which is the finance cost what we incur. So in the external sense the high premiums are strengthening, we look — look-forward to an improved spread atmosphere because of the tightness in supply and a positive monsoon impact on the Indian sugar production thereby curtailing the export of Indian sugar in the current year. Energy prices are coming off and we are seeing the effect of that flowing through into the coming financial year. Yes, interest rates, we have peaked at this point of time, in our opinion. So going forward we should be in a position to also control our finance and interest cost to a larger extent. So that’s the prognosis as a refinery business segment is concerned. This is Sridhar here. And on the distillery segment, while the topline has grown there has been pressure on the bottom line. There are two factors which are influencing as far as the distillery profitability is concerned. One is the fuel prices have moved up substantially during the year compared to the previous year. The coal prices have gone up. And number two is we actually do a transfer of molasses based on the market price from sugar segment to be distillery segment and there has been an increase in the molasses transfer price and because of which we will see the profits being better in sugar segment and it is lower in the distillery segment. This is again to do with the market price of molasses which is what we adopt four the transfer pricing between the sugar segment and the distillery segment. I hope I have answered your question.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Karan Mehta — Nirzar Securities — Analyst,"Okay, so moving forward we expect better margins in the distillery segment?",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
A. Sridhar — Chief Financial Officer,The fuel prices are getting normalized and we definitely see there is good margins to pick-up in the subsequent periods. And lot of efficiency improvements are also being without out. So we will definitely see a good progress as far as the distillery bottom-line is concerned. And I would request Muthu Murugappan to respond with reference to the Nutraceutical segment.,EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Muthiah Murugappan — Whole time Director and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, thanks Sridhar. So you know in response from the Nutra perspective, we had two reasons for the consolidated loss. But because the expenses on [Indecipherable], which is the D2C business at Valensa So that is still in a burn mode. So there is obviously a large expense booked over that. We also had some product — product loss on account of higher accident in a warehouse. This is a third-party warehousing in Florida. So there is insurance claim, which we are expecting to receive, but then that has been expensed as a loss in this quarter. We are optimistic of receiving that insurance claim in subsequent quarter.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Karan Mehta — Nirzar Securities — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Thank you sir for all the clarifications that was very helpful. Thank you.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Operator,"Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] We take the next question from the line of Mr. Ritwik Sheth from One Up Financial. Please go ahead, sir.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Ritwik Sheth — One Up Financial — Analyst,"Hi, good afternoon sir. Sir, just couple of questions, firstly on the refinery, in the presentation we have mentioned that the refinery spread is about 43, $44 per ton and our conversion costs have spiked up because of higher fuel prices. So reducing fuel prices. This can we expect this negative spread to be at least breakeven in FY ’24?",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
A. Sridhar — Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you for the question. There are couple of areas of determent that you will in the coming years. As you rightly mentioned, the fuel down and that should flow-through the operating cost of the refinery going-forward. Second is with respect to the spread, which we are also seeing at a higher-level than what had been there in the previous years. This is primarily due to tightening up of demand/supply in the sugar market and it is expected to remain tighter as per the projections as what our MD also explained in his opening note. As a result of which we should be in a better situation going-forward. That would be our summary on the refining segment.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Ritwik Sheth — One Up Financial — Analyst,"Okay, so we can at least breakeven in FY ’24 at least we can assume that.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
A. Sridhar — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, that’s what we’re working towards so.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Ritwik Sheth — One Up Financial — Analyst,"Okay. And sir on this refinery, you mentioned in your opening remarks that we have taken a INR106 crore impairment charge for PSR IPL. So anything else which can come in the future or this is more or less done with any of the impairment? And specifically, what is this related to, if you can throw some light on that also, please.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
S. Suresh — Managing Director,"Yeah, as far as the impairment with respect to the refinery investment is concerned, we have taken a good look at the forward possibilities of the refinery and this has been factored in, in terms of the workings that have been made to arrive at the current impairment value.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Ritwik Sheth — One Up Financial — Analyst,"Okay. Okay and sir the total debt including the loan given from EID Parry to the refining subsidiary would be close to INR800 crores. Is that assumption, right?",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
A. Sridhar — Chief Financial Officer,You are asking about the loan position?,EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Ritwik Sheth — One Up Financial — Analyst,"Right, in refinery?",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
A. Sridhar — Chief Financial Officer,In the refinery business the loan position from long-term borrowings is about INR200 crores. And on the short-term borrowings it is INR620 crores.,EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Ritwik Sheth — One Up Financial — Analyst,"Okay, sure. And sir one final question from my end. We have exceptionally turnaround the standalone EID Parry business in the last three to four years. And we are generating cash flow from the standalone excluding the other income, the dividend income that we received from Coromandel. So what are our thoughts in terms of dividend payout from EID Parry, especially after FY ’24 since most of the capex in the distillery side would be completed. So if you can give us some color on that, it would be very helpful.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Muthiah Murugappan — Whole time Director and Chief Executive Officer,"So, Muthu here, let me — let me answer that question. So I think the intent is to, as you said, run a very robust business on the core business, which is a standalone business. And ensure that that business is cash-generating, which will then enable us to you know better imagine the future and better implement and execute on our future plan using the sort of power and strength of the standalone business. So I think that’s the intent with which we are taking things forward. So I wouldn’t like to comment on the dividends. I think that the aspiration of course will be to pass the dividend to, but I think I would like to sort of stay with the standalone business and sort of reiterate, the focus on strengthening the standalone business and then growing it further using the sort of power of the standalone DNN [Phonetic] and balance sheet.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Ritwik Sheth — One Up Financial — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Sure sir, thank you and all the best.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
Operator,"Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for the day. I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing comments.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry 
S. Suresh — Managing Director,"Yeah, thank you everyone for taking the time out for this investor call. And hope to see you in the next call. Thank you.",EIDPARRY,EID Parry

This conference call may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, which are based on beliefs, opinions and expectations of the Company as on the date of this call. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. [Operator Instructions]",GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Harsh Gandhi. Joint Managing Director, GRP Limited for his opening remarks. Thank you and over to you, sir.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Thank you so much. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on GRP Limited’s conference call to discuss the earnings of quarter four as well as fiscal year 2023. Along with me here today, I have our Company’s CFO, Ms. Shilpa Mehta and SG&A [Phonetic] our Investor Relation Advisors to assist on the call. We have already uploaded our investor presentation on the stock exchanges and the Company website. And I hope each of you have had the opportunity to go through the same.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,Fiscal year ’23 has been a fairly busy year for all of us at GRP Limited having undergone several structural changes and undertaken various new initiatives during the year and I’m outlining all of those as under. At the beginning of the year GRP sold its entire shareholding in Marangoni GRP Private Limited. It was a joint venture company. This sale resulted in a gain of INR5.7 crores for GRP. The decision to sell the investment in the joint venture as indicated in the past is on account of a strategic shift in GRP’s portfolio and priorities and we want to continue maintaining leadership position as a material supplier.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,During the year we also incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary named Grp Circular Solutions Limited with an objective to expand focus on recycling plastic waste. The motivation for a separate company for plastic recycling hinges on the Government of India’s plans under the extended producer responsibility and the numerous opportunities that have arisen out of that regulation for development and partnerships in the field.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Within Grp Circular Solutions Limited the first set of products that GRP has launched are repurposed polyolefins. This business aims to provide sustainable and circular material solutions further rigid packaging industry. GRP, or GCSL in this case, will convert end-of-life polyolefin rigid packaging materials into raw materials with a performance which will be relatively close to virgin raw materials. During the fiscal year FY23, 6,000 ton capacity was added in this business under the repurposed polyolefin. And I’m pleased to announce that while we installed capacity we also were able to gain approval of several large customers for this. GRP or GCSL has become the only approved supplier or partner to a premier global petrochemical brand, namely Mobil [Phonetic] for use of the material in commercial sales made with 50% post-consumer recycled polypropylene. The applications of these materials that GCSL has developed will range from paint pails to lubricant pails to automotive battery covers and packaging pallets. GCSL continues to engage with several brand owners across each of these sectors for product approval, and we are fairly confident during this year to be able to gain more prominence in this business.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"In line with maintaining the focus on end of life tire and plastic recycling, GRP also announced the divestment of its stake of close to 100% stake in its wholly-owned subsidiary Grip Polymers Limited. Deepening our commitment during the year to renewable energy and operational efficiency, GRP made additional investments in windmills during the year. With acquiring three new windmills, our total wind energy capacity across all locations stands at about 4.35 megawatt and this move is aimed at increasing our sustainable energy sources and yet achieving cost reduction in a highly power intensive industry.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"The implementation of this acquisition is expected to have a positive impact on GRP’s energy cost starting the second quarter of FY24, and we should be able to demonstrate those savings in the energy costs thereafter. This investment aligns with GRP’s long-term sustainability goals while providing an opportunity to optimize operational expenses as well as enhancing cost efficiencies. This investment in the wind energy was in addition to GRP having commissioned a 500 kilowatt solar energy plant at its premises in Solapur. With that investment, which was made during the early part of the fiscal year, the connected load of solar energy across different GRP locations stands at about 1.6 megawatt. With combination of the windmill and solar energy investments today,",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"GRP’s total renewable energy sources are at about 6 megawatt and that contributes to about 60% of the connected load of the GRP operations, which is at about 10 megawatt. In terms of number of units, all of these renewable energy units contribute to roughly 27% of the units consumed at all the operating facilities.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,We maintain our commitment to renewable energy as a source of cleaning the environment as well as the focus on operational efficiencies. And during the current year we have further plans to add between 2.5 megawatt to 2.75 megawatt of renewable energy in the form of wind and solar sources.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Apart from the above, GRP has made a conscious decision to consolidate its operations across the western states of India, which is namely Maharashtra and Gujarat. And with that as an objective, we have sold the land and buildings where an erstwhile reclaimed rubber facility existed in Perundurai in the state of Tamil Nadu. To cement our commitment towards the western region, GRP commissioned a semi-processing plant for manufacturing crumb rubber at the Company’s land or the Company’s facility in Dahej in Gujarat. This site, for the time being, will augment capacities in Ankleshwar and Panoli but will have a long-term focus on other recycled product manufacturing. So with this, while Tamil Nadu has been divested off GRP has added Dahej as another location for manufacturing capability going forward.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"During the last quarter of the financial year an unfortunate incident was the fire at our facility in Solapur. This is the facility where the expansion or the diversification efforts of our company were based which is in the plant where the non-reclaimed rubber businesses were housed. While we at GRP have accorded highest priority to fire safety and have systems for effective combat against such incidents, this unfortunate incident did take place and has been an eye-opener for us.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Fortunately, there were no casualties or injuries and the fixed assets and the inventory at the location were adequately covered by insurance. GRP has lodged an insurance claim totaling INR16.45 crores for the damage caused on account of the fire. The insurance company has made an on-account payment of INR2.5 crores at the moment and we hope to receive the entire claim during the current financial year. We’ve already started and made efforts to upgrade the existing infrastructure for improved prevention, detection and mitigation of fire across all the other locations at GRP as well.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"In the meantime, to restore normalcy in the business operations following the fire incident, GRP has already taken several steps to put several of the equipment up in regular production. A lot of these were through repairs, a lot of — some of them were also replacement of equipment that were completely damaged. We were able to shift the equipment to a newly-constructed building and apart from the production that will be done on the same site, we have also entered into a contract manufacturing facility of certain products and SKUs and initiated customer supplies from the outsourcing facility.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"We’ve been able to restore all fire fighting equipment at the Solapur plant for safety purposes and planning for construction and repair of the damaged structures is ongoing and will be completed within the next three to four months. Now, let me provide you a quick snapshot on the operational side. The volume growth in the reclaimed rubber business, which continues to be the largest business for the Company, was at about 5%. This was at an increase or an improved pace in the first three quarter of the year, but there was a degrowth in the last quarter of the year and that slowdown is on account of a slowdown in exports to the European Union and North America which affected the overall volume growth.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Despite this, the domestic sales have maintained the market share and while there has been an overall rubber consumption increase of about 4%, your company has been able to grow its domestic share by a factor which is higher than 4%. The engineering plastic business experienced a high volume growth of about 30% until the third quarter. However, margins were negatively impacted for the 12-month period due to the fire incident. There has been a 9% increase in power tariff and changes in the product mix have resulted in increased energy costs. So, while we have made investments to add renewable energy sources, we are expecting those to help reduce power costs in the current year and going forward. We’ve taken conscious efforts at reducing the working capital cycle and we’ve been able to achieve a seven-day reduction in working capital cycle compared to the previous year through improved efforts at working capital management. And that is obviously leading to lower utilization of external borrowings as well as tighter control over the rest of the working capital. There has been a significant reduction in international freight costs starting Q4 of the financial year FY23, and we are hoping that most of those benefits will be retained by the Company in the current year, and we are expecting the freight cost to be at those levels for most part of the current fiscal year.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"There was a decline in quarter-on-quarter revenue in both the reclaim and non reclaim businesses in the quarter four, and the drop in revenue, as has been explained, is due to an unfavorable market condition internationally, as well as the disruptions caused by the fire incident. The weak sentiment going through in European Union and North America are likely to be maintained — are likely to continue for the next two quarters. And while we have adequate visibility of orders for the next few quarters, there is definitely a volume degrowth in the international markets compared to the calendar year 2022.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"In FY23 the revenue growth also had a factor of the selling price increase which your company has been pushed through — has been able to push through to customers and also a favorable currency during the year. In the non-reclaimed rubber business for the year there has been a higher volume sales in the engineering plastic business, but the composite business degrew due to challenges that our customer faced. The rubber composite business is based on and dependent on a single customer and increased freight cost for most part of calendar year 2022, starting from the time post COVID had led to our customer going through a significant difficult time. While a lot of that is now behind us, we are hoping to start supplies and a new agreement has been put in place whereby starting this month, which is May of 2023, business has resumed with the customer with a changed ownership structure and revised capital structure.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"EBITDA margins for reclaimed rubber expanded by 40 basis points on a year-on-year basis, again based on the improved currency and lower logistics cost. In the non-reclaimed rubber business, it declined due to the volume reduction in polymer composite business, which has always been a very, very profitable business and the impact of fire in the Q4 of the year. We continue to remain optimistic about our non-reclaimed rubber businesses despite its relatively small base and despite the challenges that we have faced in the last financial year. The increased capacity that has been created and the positive business prospects on account of customer approvals are encouraging and we remain confident of this business growing at a significantly higher rate than the traditional reclaimed rubber business will.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"We have started to leverage the synergies from the reclaimed rubber business into the non-reclaimed rubber business by way of improved collection efficiencies as well as technology differentiations that we’ve been able to create in the non-reclaimed rubber business. We continue to remain positive and confident and in this year, in this financial year, we are also hoping for a significant boost in both margins as well as revenue on account of the full scale implementation of the extended producer responsibility in both the tire as well as the plastic recycling industries.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"With this backdrop, let me hand over the floor to Shilpa to take you through the financial highlights for the quarter as well as the year gone by.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Shilpa Mehta — Chief Financial Officer,"Good afternoon, everyone. Let me take you through the consolidated financial highlights for quarter four of FY23 and for the financial year FY23. We are starting with quarter four. So revenue from operations in Q4 of FY23 was at INR955 million as compared to INR112 million in Q4 of FY22. So it was down by 14% on year-on-year basis.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Shilpa Mehta — Chief Financial Officer,Revenue degrowth was on account of reduction in volume by 9% and due to slowdown in European Union and North America which resulted in lower export revenues for reclaimed rubber and also due to impact of fire on non-reclaimed business. Gross profit for Q4 of ’23 is INR483 million as compared to INR625 million in corresponding Q4 of FY22 which is down by 23% on a year-on-year basis.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Shilpa Mehta — Chief Financial Officer,EBITDA for Q4 FY23 is INR58 million versus INR80 million of Q4 of FY22 and that was down by 27%. EBITDA margin for Q4 FY23 is at 6.1% which was at 7.2% in Q4 of previous year. Profit after tax for Q4 is at INR28 million which was in last year Q4 was at INR23 million. So it was up by 19% on year-on-year basis.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Shilpa Mehta — Chief Financial Officer,"Now let us go to FY 23. So FY23 to FY22 comparison, revenue from operations in FY23 was at INR4,510 million as compared to INR3,884 million in FY22 which is up by 16%. This revenue growth of 16% is backed by increased volumes, higher realization and favorable currency.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Shilpa Mehta — Chief Financial Officer,Gross profit for FY23 stood at INR2417 million as compared to INR2064 million in FY22 which is up by 17%. EBITDA for FY23 is at INR248 million as compared to INR232 million in FY22 which again grew by 7%. This growth in EBITDA is led by growth in revenue and coupled with reduction in freight costs. EBITDA margin is at 5.5% as compared to 6% in FY22. Profit after tax is at INR139 million in FY23 compared to INR58 million in FY22 which is up by 142% on year-on-year basis. This PAT growth was from improved volume growth and one-time gains from sell-off assessed investments in JV company and subsidiary.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Shilpa Mehta — Chief Financial Officer,"On the debt side, I’m pleased to share that we were able to reduce our gross debt which includes both long term and short term by INR113 million from INR997 million to INR883 million in FY23. And our debt/equity ratio is 0.59 in FY23 which was at 0.73 in FY22.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Shilpa Mehta — Chief Financial Officer,"With this, I now open the floor for question and answers. Thank you.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Shilpa Mehta — Chief Financial Officer,Questions and Answers:,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Vivek Ganguly from Nine Rivers Capital. Please go ahead.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Vivek Ganguly — Nine Rivers Capital — Analyst,"Thank you for the opportunity. I had one question on the EPR targets. I was trying to understand the space a little better. Referring to — hello, can you hear me?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, you’re audible. But I didn’t catch the first part of the question regarding —",GRP,GRP Limited 
Vivek Ganguly — Nine Rivers Capital — Analyst,"No, no, so I have not yet completed the question. My bad. No. So, referring to Slide 17, where you had charted out the EPR targets. So if you can explain this a little better in the sense if a company is manufacturing uses, let’s say, 100 kilos of rubber, so is that 35% of that has to be reclaimed rubber? Is that what it means and how does this play out? I’m referring to slide number 17.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, I’m seeing that. So thanks, Vivek, for the question. So, I think there are two parts to the EPR story. One is the obligations of the tire manufacturers and what we need to do. So, if you look at that particular chart and talking about 35% is the thing what is happening. What this means is that for the manufacturers or importers of new tires, whatever is the quantity of tires that they have produced two years before, which is basically, if you look at the bottom, it says that it will start after two years and shall be 100% of the tires manufacturers or imported in the year Y minus two. Which means in FY23, whatever was their production or import of FY21, 35% of that needs to be bought back by way of credits in the year FY23. So, as a tire producer, if in FY21 they had produced 100 tons of tires, they are required to purchase 35 tons of credit in the year FY23. That’s what this chart means. And similarly, again, their production of FY22, they need to purchase credits for that in FY24 to the extent of 70% of the production of the year FY22 and so on.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Vivek Ganguly — Nine Rivers Capital — Analyst,So this is applicable to India or this is applicable on a global scenario?,GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"This is only what is sold — manufactured while it says manufactured, if you look at the definition within the EPR, it is actually sales of tires in India. And that’s the reason for the tire companies, it will be net domestic sales and for the tire importers as well, this will be the total tires sold in India and the percentage of that by way of credits that they need to purchase two years later.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Vivek Ganguly — Nine Rivers Capital — Analyst,"So how does the credit purchase work out in the sense, let’s say, if reclaimed rubber is available only to the extent of, let’s say, 5%, so the remaining 30%, they will have to buy credits. And where do they buy the credits from, in what form?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"No. So buying credits is independent of the production that they have done. So if the country as a whole consumes about 2 million tons of tires, as an example, 35% of that will need to be bought in terms of credits from recyclers two years later. And the expectation, therefore, is that as the regulation tightens and the producers or the brand owners are obligated to buy these credits, there will be obviously a growth in the recycling activity in the country.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Now, the recycling activity is already being defined by way of the end products that are produced, reclaimed rubber and then similarly crumb rubber and then several other types of end of life recycling are eligible to be sold as sold for credits. So reclaim rubber, whatever production of reclaimed rubber that we as an industry or the country produces, that much of credits will be available to the industry to sell to the tire companies and the tire companies will be obligated to buy those credits from the different recyclers.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Vivek Ganguly — Nine Rivers Capital — Analyst,"So would you all be like, say — and please, I’m new to the space, I’m trying to understand this. So if, let’s say, 30% is the obligation, but the rubber that is reclaimed or reprocessed recycled is only X percentage. So if you sell that to, let’s say, a tire that will be considered as a credit which is used in fulfilling their obligation?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,No. So the consumption of reclaimed rubber or crumb rubber does not earn any benefit for the tire companies. They have to buy credits from recyclers independent of what they use within the tire manufacturing processes.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Vivek Ganguly — Nine Rivers Capital — Analyst,"So how does that work, because if they have to buy something, some assets, whether it is a real asset or a virtual asset, has to be generated. So what is that asset that will get generated?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Every ton of reclaim or every ton of recycled rubber that is produced, and again, there are multiple types of recycled rubbers as defined under the EPR policy, every ton of that product will generate a certain value of credit and that will be regulated through the pollution control board through a portal that has been created and at the moment is under beta testing. And hopefully in the next few weeks that should kind of go operational as a result of which credits will be generated for the recyclers and will be traded across an exchange to be sold to the tire manufacturers.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Vivek Ganguly — Nine Rivers Capital — Analyst,"Right, just to clarify. So if you generate 1 ton of reclaimed rubber, so maybe you will get an equivalent of one unit of credit, which then you can go out and sell, put it out on an exchange which they have to buy. So does that incentivize them to buy more of reclaimed rubber or more of the credits?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"So I think at the moment the regulation is at its nascent stage and I’d be happy to have an offline conversation to kind of talk more about it, but at the moment it’s in its nascent stage. We do expect that the regulation as it is written may undergo changes because there is a steering committee that has been formed and the role of the steering committee which comprises of stakeholders from across different parts of the business. There’s an expectation that there will be modifications to some of the policy guidelines that are in there and that the steering committee is empowered to make.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,So in what form does it finally get sanctioned and approved and implemented that kind of remains to be seen. But some of what you asked for are questions that the steering committee is also deliberating.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Vivek Ganguly — Nine Rivers Capital — Analyst,Okay. Thank you. That’s all from my side.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rohit from Ithod PMS. Please go ahead.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,Yeah. Hello? Am I audible?,GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Yes, go ahead.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. So I have a few questions. One was [Indecipherable] retail business, so do you think that this year —",GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"Rohit, we are not able to hear you clearly. Your voice is sounding very muffled.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,Is it any better now?,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,Slightly better. Please proceed.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,"So my question was in terms of our reclaimed rubber business, so you alluded to a few things in your opening remarks. Freight costs this year, I mean, now have come down significantly, especially in the H2. So going into FY24, how do you see the margins in the reclaimed rubber business specifically adjusted for the slowdown that you’re seeing in the export markets? If you can just give an outlook on that.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, thanks. So again, I mean — so freight has reduced. I think, different — depending on the different trade lanes the impact or the extent of the reduction varies. But to put it in context, the freight cost reduction has been anywhere between 30% to 50% on several trade routes. Now the impact on margins will depend obviously on the different customers and the volumes that are kind of going out to the different customers. So tough for me to give you an exact number on what that rupees per KG Or rupee crore would be. But I would say that at this moment from a high of freight cost which was in excess of about INR50 crores for the years that we have seen in the past, we are seeing that freight costs have by and large reduced by, as I said, anywhere between 30% to 50%.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"So that’s the likely overall impact on the on the cost of freight. Against that how much will get passed on to customers versus how much will be retained by the customers is a case-to-case basis. I mean there are several customers where the freight was a direct pass through and in those cases our pricing is moderated or adjusted to reflect the revised freight costs. In some cases where the risk of the freight based on the [Indecipherable] terms was for GRP, those are the ones where we will continue to retain the margin that will get accrued on account of the freight cost reduction. So it’s a mixed bag. I’m unable to give you an exact number. But I can definitely say that on a net basis it will definitely be margin positive for the Company.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,"No, I was not actually asking for specific numbers but just broadly because you alluded to a couple of things. One, obviously freight costs have come down. At the same time demand is a bit subdued in export markets and also power costs have also gone up. So putting all in total, I mean in terms of the segmental performance that we see on the reclaimed rubber side last two quarters I’ve seen some margin improvement where we touched close to 9% and 10%. So do you think there are — I mean from here on the margins will continue to go up, given everything put together? That’s what I wanted to understand.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah. No so we are fairly optimistic that the margins will certainly be better in the next — I mean will continue to get better for the next two or three quarters because the impact on account of rate will certainly be net positive. As far as power costs are concerned, again as you’ve seen that there has been about a 9% to 10% increase in unit cost. But that we are also more than offsetting by way of the investments that we have made in the renewable energies. One additional factor which I’ve not kind of talked about but this is — it’s going to impact this year is that there has been a one-time 25% increase in the minimum wages in the state of Gujarat. While most of our workforce was earning slightly more than minimum wage, there will be a one-time adjustment on account of this minimum wage increase in the state of Gujarat. But putting all of these three put together as well, we are still expecting that the margins on the whole for the reclaimed rubber business will be definitely positive net net.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"In terms of percentage or basis point improvement my expectation is, as you’ve said, it has gone up already to closer to about 8%-odd. We are fairly optimistic and hopeful that it should get into double digits fairly soon or probably are already in that territory and should start getting reflected in the overall numbers.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,Right. And just one more question on this overall power cost. So do you see power cost at an absolute level for you remaining stagnant or sort of not increasing or coming down from next two of this year because of the investments that you’ve made? Do you see that or that’s still a tall ask?,GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"So on a rupee per unit basis, there will be a reduction in the rupee per unit cost. And of course energy is the second largest cost within the operating cost structure. So clearly there will be a savings on account of that. I mean, to put it plainly, as I said, we’ll be at about 27% of our energy will be coming from this power. If I add up all of that together, it’s representing a total saving of roughly INR4.5-odd crore. If we were to do a comparison of direct grid power versus this 27% coming from renewable and therefore that impact will start flowing in again from Q2 of this year.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,"Understood. Now moving on to the non-reclaimed side of the business, I remember this year we had also expanded capacity and we were quite optimistic at the beginning of the year to utilize that expanded capacity based on customer sort of soft commitments. However, obviously I understand that the composite business has an issue and also the demand overall has also become subdued. So just generally wanted to understand how do you see that business because you consistently maintain that that business is much more profitable. However, that is yet to be seen from at an overall level due to the low offtake. Could you sort of explain that also?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, so I mean our non-reclaimed businesses, as I said before, just to kind of do a little recap, we have two businesses within that currently and — which is the engineering plastic business and the composite business. Engineering plastic business continues to grow. In fact, as we expanded capacity or doubled capacity during the year, we were close to getting to about 70% utilization of that capacity based on the orders in hand as on February of this year. However, on account of the fire, I would say we’ve been set back because a lot of the capacity that was added some of it kind of has been lost to the fire and we are in the process of restoring that. As far as business itself or the order situation there itself is concerned, we will have an overall capacity based on all the expansion, etc., at about 7,000 tons on an annual basis. I would say that we were at about 70% to 75% of that capacity by way of orders by February. So as and when we are able to restore that capacity, we are fairly confident that by the end of the year we should get to about, 80% 85% of that utilization once the equipment are all restored and the building is up and operational.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as the composite business is concerned, as I said, we had a volume degrowth which was close to 50% from the previous year. But from March of this year, because of the renewed contracts, we have restarted that operation. Again we won’t be able to go back to peak capacity because there also we have lost about one-third of the capacity to the fire. And while we restore that, the business will slowly kind of inch up. We are hoping that that business also by the end of the year will get back to about 70% of what its capability is.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"So net net both these businesses, the order situation as well as the customer outlook is looking fairly positive. It’s a question of when we are able to get the capacities up and running. But otherwise we are not seeing either of these businesses affected by the downturn in any way because these are both serving a very different niche end application and we are fairly confident of getting back to that 70%, 75% capacity utilization.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"The other non-reclaimed business is the polypropylene or the plastic business that we have set up. There, again, we’ve been set back by about three years on account of — three months, I’m sorry, three to four months on account of the fire. Another change that has happened there is that the regulation on the plastic packaging under EPR has been pushed back by one year and in light of that we are hoping that we will get back to about 40% to 50% utilization before the end of the year. The approvals are kind of slowly, slowly trickling in and coming through. Our supply chain for sourcing waste plastic is in place and has spread to an extent that we are fairly confident of getting to close to 90% of the capacity that we have created. We have the sources in place as well. So it’s a question of when and not whether.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"So this is a brief outlook on each of the non-RR businesses. But I would say that by the time the buildings are rebuilt and the plant is completely put to use and operational, I would say it would be closer to September before the new building and the capacities are all commissioned back to its level pre February ’15.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,"Very helpful. Just one follow up on the plastics business. So despite — so in the plastics business, if my understanding is right, there will be two kind of revenue line items, right? One is the credits and that would also be there in the reclaimed rubber part, but just to be focusing on the plastics part for a bit, you’ll also sell the repurposed polyolefins and also you’ll sell the credits. So do you expect both these to contribute in FY24 or the purpose part with the customer that you got approval with to begin with in the FY24?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"So the EPR revenue impact in the plastic, as I said, the mandate has been pushed back by a year, but a lot of voluntary purchase of credits is already ongoing. So yes, there will be an EPR income generated from the plastic recycling businesses and that includes both the composite business as well as the repurposed polyolefin business. So that will be net positive as far as the P&L is concerned. Of course it will be split between GRP and GCSL, which is where the repurposed polyolefin business is housed.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as tires is concerned, we are confident that that will start generating a positive EPR income in this fiscal itself because we are not expecting that to be deferred for any reason.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,"I think one of the — one company’s conference call, it was shared that the plastic credits depending on the product, the pricing range has been INR2 to INR20 a kilo. I mean, can you talk a bit about what kind of realization are you guys looking at for your product and how do you see that? Any sense that you can share?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"I think the pricing that people are talking about is a little speculative because currently it is voluntary. We’ve seen prices range anywhere from INR1 a kilo to as much as what you mentioned. I don’t think the markets have stabilized or matured where one can predict what’s the likely unit revenue that one can generate per credit. So it’s very early days, if I may, to kind of be able to put that out. I mean, we have already started selling some credits and as I said, the prices range depending on the brand owner as well as the stability that we are able to provide the credits with. I mean, too early. I think once the market is better, I would say organized and the mandates are clearly in place. That’s when the true discovery of the price per credit will happen.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,Got it. And the right way to think about that —,GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Thank you, Rohit. Come back. I am sure there’s others waiting in the queue.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Balakrishnan — ithought PMS — Analyst,"Yeah, yeah.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,Thanks so much.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Umang Shah from India Bridge Capital. Please go ahead.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Umang Shah — India Bridge Capital — Analyst,"Hi, sir. Thank you for taking my questions. [Technical Issues]",GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"Sorry to interrupt. Mr. Shah. Sir, your audio is breaking up.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Umang Shah — India Bridge Capital — Analyst,Is it getting better?,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"No sir, it’s still the same.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Umang Shah — India Bridge Capital — Analyst,Can you hear me now?,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"Sir, we are able to hear you, but your audio is breaking up. So we won’t be able to hear the complete question.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Umang Shah — India Bridge Capital — Analyst,"[Technical Issues] In the previous year, the realization that we received, especially in the export market have been much higher as compared to previous years in case of reclaimed rubber. And yet there’s no increase in the operating margins or the gross margins. Any reason for the same?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"I’m sorry, export realization has improved. I didn’t get you. I’m sorry, I didn’t follow the question at all. Your voice and line is not really very clear.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Umang Shah — India Bridge Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,Hello.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Umang Shah — India Bridge Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, can you hear [Technical Issues]",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"I’m sorry, but I’m not able to hear you clearly at all. Your voice is breaking and I’m only hearing a few words and not the entire question.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Umang Shah — India Bridge Capital — Analyst,No problem. I will rejoin the queue.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,Hello.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Sir, he’ll be rejoining the queue. We’ll move on to the next question that is from the line of Ajay Surya from Niveshaay. Please go ahead.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Ajay Surya — Niveshaay — Analyst,"Yeah. Hi, sir. So my question is, if I look at the past, before pyrolysis started to take off, we had operating margins in the range of like 13%, 15% and even 18% sometimes. But post 2012, the margins never reached double digits and remained around 5%, 7% level. But now with the EPR policy coming in, which will reduce the pyrolysis activity, can we see our margin go back to those levels coming next one, two years post the EPR implementation?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"I’ll divide this into two parts. One is 10 years is a very longtime for an industry to continue to have or exhibit the same kind of performances. So I think what has happened 10, 11 years ago, I mean — I think economic memory is generally a lot more short term than that. So I wouldn’t necessarily want to comment on that as to what the performance was and what the margins were 10 or 11 years ago. As far as the margin improvement on account of EPR is concerned, which your question is, yes, it will be definitely positive for the Company, as I’ve mentioned already before. But because I’m unable to predict what will be the price of the credit or the revenue that one will generate for the credit, it is very difficult to quantify what it will mean in terms of margin percentage or operating margin percentage as far as reclaimed rubber is concerned.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"If I again was to sort of make a general statement on how by reclaimed rubber, business itself is growing and how the margins have been on a quarter-on-quarter basis, clearly there is an improvement that we are seeing quarter after quarter. Except, as I said, there’s been a little bit of a dip in sales in Q4 but other than that, the contribution or the margins have certainly started to show an improvement and we’re fairly confident that if the demand holds, these margins will continue getting better.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Ajay Surya — Niveshaay — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Sir, my next question is regarding the non-reclaim part, if we look at like nylon as replacing the metals and automotive, what is the trend towards recycled nylon? Like, are we seeing 20%, 30% kind of recycled nylon used in the industry or how much recycling content is used? Can you throw some light on that?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"It’s a great question. Thanks so much for asking. I think nylon, you’re right by and large, is replacing different kind of materials itself. And if you look at the engineering plastic industry in India, the growth has been faster than the rest of the plastic industry. That’s clearly indicating that nylon, apart from other engineering plastics, are continuing to replace other kind of polymers or even in some cases, other kind of materials. As you give us the right example that nylon is replacing in some applications metal that was being used.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Within that space or within the stream of engineering plastics, what is the share of recycled nylon? Again, that is dependent on the end application? I can only say that, for example, very recently Kia and Hyundai have gone out on record to say that the plastic components used in the automotive can incorporate up to 30% recycled content in there. Now, this is a very big sweeping statement made by a large brand owner who has a global footprint. What it means and when all of those will get reflected in the compound formulation changes is a process which the OEs and Tier-1s will start working with these brand owners over a period of time. Is it helping us? Yes. We have been able to get a few auto company approvals for our nylon — compounded nylon and it is starting to replace some amount of virgin nylon in several applications. What is the percentage of replacement? If I was to say it is ranging again from as little as 5% to in some cases it has gone up to about 15% to 20% replacement of the virgin nylon.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Now in automotive which is the largest consumer of the engineering plastics, it’s the largest impact but it’ll probably be a slow-moving impact. Where the impact we are seeing more pronounced is in the electrical and in the furniture sector where the percentage of recycled nylon is already in high double digits in some cases, high teens, in some cases, even in the 20% range, and so on and so forth. So I do believe that the nonautomotive applications will switch more towards recycled plastic materials than the pace at which the automotive manufacturers will switch. So clearly that is a positive for us in the industry. But I want to also caution you that while nylon is replacing certain types of metals, you have to be cognizant that in the long run certain type of polyolefin materials when compounded is also replacing some amount of engineering plastic. So it’s going to be a cycle where everybody will need to be ahead of the curve and make sure that they are able to produce cost-efficient material with the performance properties of the next material that is in the hierarchy. I hope that answers the question, but that’s in a nutshell what is happening.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Another major change that is happening in the industry, which all of us are seeing is that a lot of consolidation has taken place, especially in the engineering plastic industry. If you look at India alone, we had more than 15, 20 engineering plastic compounders in the country until five years ago. Today that number is in its single digits. And this is because a lot of capacity has been consolidated through either M&A activity or international players coming and setting up operations in the country, as a result of which several domestic companies have kind of become redundant.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Now, as this is happening, most of the international or the multinational compounders who are integrated across the value chain are focused more on the higher end applications. And that has actually left a little bit of a gap or a void in the general-purpose recycled engineering plastic space. And that is actually a lot of it is in the electrical and the furniture and this space. And that’s a positive that we are seeing for our company because we are focused on the recycled materials and are able to offer products for those end applications which we’ve been able to get approval for.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"So net net, it’s a positive, but I would say substitution in the automotive industry is slow, but it’s the largest volume. Substitution in electrical and furniture is high and fast, but it’s a smaller volume. And the consolidation in the industry is also leaving behind some space for compounders like us to kind of take market share in the general-purpose recycled engineering plastic space. I hope that answers the question.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Ajay Surya — Niveshaay — Analyst,"Yes, thank you for such a detailed response. Sir, my final question is regarding, like you said, there are a lot of M&A activities in this engineered plastic compounders. So can we see that and even reclaim rubber because credits will have to be purchased by tire companies and unorganized industry? We have seen reclaimed rubber being a little bit of unorganized industry. So can we see them being target for tire companies?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,Are you asking whether tire companies will be looking at reclaimed rubber producers to be acquired? Is that what your question is? If I got it correctly.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Ajay Surya — Niveshaay — Analyst,"Yeah, yeah. Yes.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,I think that’s a question you need to ask the tire companies. I’m not sure whether I can answer that with any level of certainty.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Ajay Surya — Niveshaay — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Thank you.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,Thank you.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Ajay Surya — Niveshaay — Analyst,Thank you so much. All the very best.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll move on to the next question. That is from the line of Akash Meta from Capaz Investments. Please go ahead.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Akash Meta — Capaz Investments — Analyst,"Hi, sir. Good afternoon and thanks for the opportunity. I had two different questions. First one, I think you mentioned in the speech regarding the semi processing plant for manufacture of crumb rubber. So if you could just provide some more details on the same? And what is the demand that we expect for crumb rubber as such?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Sure. So currently the plant that has been set up in Dahej is to meet the internal needs of the GRP reclaimed rubber facilities in Ankleshwar and Panoli. But this is a facility that has been operationalized for the time being. Dahej is a very strategic location because it is very close to the tire companies there. I mean, there are two large tire companies operating within the vicinity of a few hundred meters from where our existing factory is. We’ve started with producing, as I said, crumb rubber to feed the reclaimed rubber units. But we do believe that that location provides a strategic advantage to do a lot more. And it could be a lot of downstream possibilities. It could be — with the crumb rubber itself there are many applications in the rubber industry as well as in the non-rubber industry. There is also opportunities to diversify from a technology point of view into alternate technologies for reclaimed rubber.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"And there are several things on the table. I don’t have an answer on what we will do there with a three-year horizon. We are working on a lot of things and we will continue to see how we can put that asset to much better use than what it is being done today. For the time being, it’s only serving the needs of Ankleshwar and Panoli reclaimed rubber units.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Akash Meta — Capaz Investments — Analyst,"Okay, so the internal consumption. And on the second, I had a question on the order book. If you could provide me the details, the orders in hand for the non-reclaimed and reclaimed rubber segment and some insights on the order book, whether it is from new customers or from the existing ones?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as the order book and reclaimed rubber is concerned, we’ve had Q4, as I said already, has been a weak quarter. Even this quarter, which is Q1 of this fiscal first part of the quarter, has been a little tepid in terms of the demand. But we’re starting to see some increased activity coming back again, mostly in the domestic industry and some amount in the nontraditional market. So we’re starting to see revival of demand in Latin America, in some parts of Asia.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Europe and North America continue to remain more or less the same as what they have been in Q4 of last year. Now, if you look at the presentation that’s been put up on the website and I think this is slide number 16, there is already an indication of what the global tire markets look like. And I think that should give you a fair sense of what is happening world over in terms of the tire production and what it therefore means for consumption of different materials.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"I mean, in India we’ve had a smallish growth in the rubber consumption or in the offtake. Internationally, I think it’s only been 0.8%, while in India it has been about 4% to 4.2%. So I mean, with that as a backdrop, I would say order book is not looking extremely encouraging where we have excess orders over capacity. I think we’re trying to increase share of wallet with our customers and trying to ensure that our market share stays ahead of competitors at this stage and that’s really what’s happening.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as the non reclaimed rubber is concerned. I already talked about what is the outlook for the engineering plastic business, where we are fairly confident of getting back to the levels, but there. It’s a capacity issue on account of the fire with composites, again, as I said, there is an order book, there is a revised contract. It’s the capacity which is, again, the challenge in terms of being able to fulfill what the entire requirement of the customer is.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,I hope that provides you a perspective of all the businesses.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Akash Meta — Capaz Investments — Analyst,"Yeah, that’s extremely helpful. Thank you, sir.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rohit Potti from Marshmallow Capital. Please go ahead.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Potti — Marshmallow Capital — Analyst,"Thank you for the opportunity once again. So most of the questions have been answered. I’m just curious to hear — I think, a couple of calls back you mentioned that we are looking to go up the value curve in reclained rubber. And we’re coming out with high performance products which would have lesser competition, which would add to the margins, and they ideally could be introduced in the current financial year. So just wanted an update on that, please.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Thank you for asking that question. Yes, advances with the new technology are at a fairly advanced stage. Again, excuse the English on that, but yeah, I mean, we are at an advanced stage of getting approvals for some of these new products that we are developing. I think before the end of the year, we will have new lines of capacity with this new technology in place. Currently, we are at the approval process with a few customers, specifically the tire companies. And we are also evaluating two different technologies for which pilots have been setup our plants at the moment. And we are fairly confident that in all likelihood, both these technologies we will be implementing on a commercial scale by the end of the year. Can’t give more details than that, but, yeah, this is, as I’ve mentioned in the past, cleaner processes and upgraded product in terms of properties, compared to what we’ve been selling so far. It’s high-performance materials produced using cleaner technologies.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Potti — Marshmallow Capital — Analyst,"Great. So, could you give — I mean, I know you don’t want to share more details. I understand that. So, in terms of entry barrier, so does it take longer to come up with the technology if a competitor has to do that? And is the approval process for these materials longer from the customers point of view, just want to know what thebarrier to entry would be here.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah, that’s a great question. Again, I think as far as the customer approval process is concerned, what we are seeing is, given the level of interest that the tire industry has in using larger percentage of these high performance reclaimed rubbers, we are seeing that the approval times are likely to be shorter than what our traditional time used to be. I used to always say that process for approval used to be between six to 24 months. I’m seeing, based on the interest of the tire industry, that these time frames will be compressed a lot more and therefore faster approvals are definitely likely to be seen and witnessed.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as barriers to entry are concerned, I would say globally there are three or four different technologies that are being tried and tested at different parts of the world. So while we are claiming that we are looking at these new technologies for high performance materials, I think several technology providers as well as competitors are also testing and evaluating alternate technologies for commissioning as well. Is it a question of either or? I don’t think so. I think it’s a question of this and that. And I think the tire industry is welcoming all these different technologies. They are evaluating different materials. So I personally feel that each of the different players be the technology provider or a recycling company if they are able to deliver on the promise of a better performance material and doing it in a cleaner way. I think the stress I want to put is this because a lot of tire companies are asking for high performance materials, but they want to make sure that the processes are cleaner with less carbon footprint than the current set of processes.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"So as long as people are able to deliver, Iam fairly confident the tire industry will be able to absorb a lot more capacity in the coming years. If you just look at the aspirations that each of them have and the information of — rather what they have put out in the public domain in terms of targets of use of this recycled material, I think they will need multiple technologies to be approved for them to get to those numbers. So I will be very surprised if they say I like this technology versus that. I think they will say this technology for this product, this technology for that product. And I think they’re going to be much quicker in adoption of these newer products.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Potti — Marshmallow Capital — Analyst,"One interesting thing, you can notice that you didn’t mention price in your whole commentary right now. So I think in reclaim rubber, at least the legacy business, the price competitiveness as against rubber and other competitive products is an important factor. So is that less of a factor in this higher performance technology?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Look, we’re going to be working with the same raw material. And because we got cleaner processes, we are not expecting that the operating costs will be significantly higher than the current technologies in use. Because while overall operating costs might go up, the cost of pollution and compliance and all of those other things are going to be lower. Similarly, energy costs might be higher, but manpower costs will be lower. So net net we believe that the overall operating cost with these newer technologies will be comparable to the current cost of technology operations and therefore the delta that will be available on the product performance will actually be margin accreditive for the entire community.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Potti — Marshmallow Capital — Analyst,"Understood. That is very helpful. And going back to the broader strategy over the next three to five years, so the last two or three years we’ve added at least two new very promising lines, right, the plastic — engineering plastics we are scaling up and the repurposed polyolefins that you referred to. So are you going to double down on the high technology reclaimed rubber and these two non-reclaimed businesses or are you adding more products? How are you thinking about that over the longer term?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"I think — I mean, if you look at or reflect on what I have mentioned in terms of divesting from non-strategic investments, including land, including subsidiary, etc., etc., we’ve kind of shored up enough cash and also the working capital efficiency that we’ve put in. I think the idea was to shore up the cash to pretty much be able to invest across this entire spectrum of technologies in the tire recycling space and in the plastic recycling space.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"The investment in the engineering plastic came naturally to us because of the linkage of the raw material. And at the moment, our expansion or the growth in that business will be linked to the extent of nylon or material that we are able to more or less generate from our own reclaimed rubber processes. So to that extent, the engineering plastic will kind of go hand in hand in terms of growth with the reclaimed rubber expansion plans.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as the polyolefin expansion is concerned, I think that will get more dependent based on product approvals from brand owners and our ability to kind of scale up the supply chain or the",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,Collection efforts.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Just another quick reminder. I mean, again, you’ll go through the financials in any case, but just something for you to watch out for is the asset turns in the reclaimed rubber have always been low, but with the new technology will move up. But the asset turns in the plastic recycling business are already much higher than what we see in the reclaimed rubber business. So, I mean, from that perspective, the ability to scale sooner with limited capital in the plastic recycling will be more effective.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Potti — Marshmallow Capital — Analyst,"Perfect. So last question from my end is, as things stand now, given the growth drivers which are reclaimed engineering plastics and the repurposed polyolefins, I know you touched upon the growth part, but growth margins and returns on the employed capital. So could you rank them in terms of as things stand now, it will be helpful, sir.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"I didn’t follow the question completely. I mean, you spoke about growth, you spoke about ROC, and you spoke about margins. Are you asking me which one is most important to rank it in the order of priority?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Potti — Marshmallow Capital — Analyst,"No, no. How do these — I mean, how do these three segments stand in these three parameters? So, growth, you’ve conveyed that repurposed olefins and probably engineering plastics are much faster growing. But in terms of margins and returns on the capital employed, how do these three segments rank is what I was curious to know.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Yeah. So, I mean, again, interesting question. When we do the discussion on capital allocation, one can’t have a myopic view. And given that the polymer industry as well as a result of the commodity industry and the pricing in there is so volatile, I mean, gone are the days when we could make five-year plans with very little variability from those plans. I think today even sticking to a one-year or a two-year plan is becoming extremely hard. Given that backdrop, I would say for the reclaimed rubber business, in the long run, the ROC will improve as we double down our efforts on different types of end products and different technologies that we will adopt. So I think there the race is against race for improving margins and ROCE are based on the pace at which we are able to get into these new technologies.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as nylon is concerned, we continue to remain competitive and the margins are high because of the back-end integration into the supply chain that is coming from the tire recycling business. So I think there I would say the margins and the ROCE [Phonetic] will probably be the highest, but there the ability to scale is limited because we will continue to depend on our own raw materials.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as repurposed polyolefin space is concerned, again, it’s a little too early to say anything because there’s very few organized competitors in this industry as of now. But that will change come 1st April, 2024, because once the mandate is in place, you will really start seeing a lot more manufacturers becoming more aggressive, more active. And as a result, whoever is able to assume pole position in terms of most brand owners as customers and product which is able to be incorporated at 30% and 50%, that is really what will dictate the future margins and ROCE. So I think as far as repurposed polyolefins is concerned, I think it’s a little too early for us to tell you where we stand in the pecking order.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"When it comes to nylon, I can confidently say that this margins and ROCE will always remain high given our backward integration. And as far as RR is concerned, our ability to commercialize this new technology will dictate how the margins and ROCE improve over the course of the next three to five years.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Rohit Potti — Marshmallow Capital — Analyst,"Thank you. That’s it from me. As always, it’s — I mean, I always enjoy your call. Thank you so much for being so elaborate.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,Appreciate the same.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kanika Kothari from Kothari Securities. Please go ahead.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Kanika Kothari — Kothari Securities — Analyst,"Yeah. Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Sir, just wanted some — I mean wanted to know if you could give any long-term guidance on revenue and margins, maybe what can be the sustainable EBITDA margins for reclaimed and non-reclaimed rubber business.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"I mean, like in the past, I’ve never been able to give a guidance on either of revenue or margins. I mean, as a policy, we’ve not really done it. So unfortunately apologies, Kanika, but I won’t be able to provide a perspective. Yes, I would say we’ve had a 17%-odd growth in revenue this year. I mean, at least for the next one or two years we are hoping, based on the capacities that we have created, that we will have a double digit growth over the course of the next two years on a sustained basis. On the margin front, again, we don’t comment on where it will go, but I’ve already given you adequate information over the call in terms of steps we are taking to improve the operating margins from where we are currently. So I think that should suffice for now. I mean, we don’t normally give out guidance on numbers, etc. as a policy. But as I said, I’ve already told you what we are doing to improve the margins. I don’t think I can comment beyond that. I hope you understand.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Kanika Kothari — Kothari Securities — Analyst,"Yeah, this helps. And lastly, just wanted to know your thoughts on maybe bonus issue or flip.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"I think at the Board level we continue to deliberate on all such capital restructuring proposals. If I may, I mean, the question that you ask in some ways I take back as a recommendation or a suggestion, which we will certainly discuss at the next Board meeting. And then if the Board does feel that our capital structure allows us to look at either of a structuring to issue bonuses, we will consider it. At this stage, I don’t have any commitment, comment or view on the same.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as split is concerned, if the objective is to sort of improve liquidity in the market. It’s also something that we have been considering and thinking about and we shall look at it and implement it at an appropriate time. Thank you for the suggestion.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Kanika Kothari — Kothari Securities — Analyst,Thank you.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Karthik Bhatt, an individual investor. Please go ahead.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Karthik Bhatt — Individual Investor — Analyst,Yeah. Am I audible?,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"Yes, sir. Please proceed.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Karthik Bhatt — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the opportunity. So my question was around the engineering classic division. Some of it was answered, I think, earlier, but I was reading up in the presentation that it has applications in consumer, automotive, electrical and electronics and so on. So what is our differentiator as such that gives us the edge versus other competition in this sector? That is one. And do we have any number in mind saying that how much will the contribution would be from the non-reclaimed business, the claim versus non-reclaimed by maybe three to four years down the line.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As I replied to Kanika. I mean, I’m not in a position to give you numbers, but long-term vision, which has been always aspirational in nature and has been sort of provided in the past as well, is that we want at some point that the non-reclaimed rubber businesses should become as large as the reclaimed business in time to come. I mean, I don’t want to set a timeline to that, but that’s the internal aspiration that we have.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as your question on competitor intensity and the niche or the advantage that we have in the engineering plastic space, as I said, the engineering plastic business is based on reprocessed nylon and glass-filled or the compounded nylon. And the nylon in this majority of this is coming from our reclaimed rubber business which is basically from end of life tires. We also use textile waste, we also use some amount of fishnet waste and combination of this is what is providing us the raw material to serve these different industries.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"As far as the automotive is concerned, I mean there are several applications which somebody asked in the past which are metal components that are moving to plastics and within that nylon. And nylon as a percentage within the automotive is kind of moving up. When it comes to electrical and electronics. I mean this is all lot to do with the switch gears as an end consumer. Industrial is actually conveying and material handling systems and consumer is things like furniture and luggage and so on which uses again a lot of nylon.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,I mean our competitive advantage is the fact that we have our own source of raw material. A lot of the other recycling companies don’t have access to in-house raw material. They are relying on collectors who are collecting end of life waste or post-industrial waste and they are buying those as market prices and being able to blend it in their compounding in our case because it’s in house that’s the leverage or the advantage that we have against our competitors. I hope that answers both parts of your question. Thank you.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"Mr. Bhatt, is your question answered?",GRP,GRP Limited 
Karthik Bhatt — Individual Investor — Analyst,Thank you.,GRP,GRP Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Harsh Gandhi for his closing comments.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"Thank you all. As I always say that for me these investor calls are more learning from all of you guys because the questions that you ask as always, are always insightful, gives us a good sense of direction and it helps us to go back to the drawing board to look for more answers for your questions. So with that, I’d like to thank each of you for the time having taken to attend the call for preparing yourselves, for asking these insightful questions. And as I said, we will go back to the drawing board, work on some of these, and we’re hoping that this year, with all the changes that we’ve made in the last year, it’ll start reflecting on much improved performance. And I guess the government regulation and the EPR implementation should help your company grow more rapidly than we have in the last one decade.",GRP,GRP Limited 
Harsh Gandhi — Joint Managing Director,"So, without referencing the gentleman who asked me about how we were 10 years ago versus now, I guess this is in some ways a new dimension for the entire industry. A lot of interest across different stakeholder communities, most importantly the customers. And we continue to remain committed to serve them, provide them with new products, new technologies and hopefully therefore better performance for all of our shareholder partners. Thank you so much for your time and appreciate the same.",GRP,GRP Limited

Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Rakesh, am I audible to you?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Yes, sir. I can hear you, sir.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"It’s Properly. Yeah, Okay.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah, I can hear you, sir.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,Yeah. Can we start with one disclaimer? You already read.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Deepak Singh — DGM,"Yes, sir. Disclaimer over. Thank you, and over to you.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,Good afternoon to everybody. I welcome all the analysts who are attending this con-call of the Panjab National Bank.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I am happy to say the result of the quarterly closing March 2023 as well as the whole of the financial year ’22-’23 of the Punjab National Bank. And before I start, I think this quarter was remained a very good quarter for the bank, because if you see last five quarters, which we have published the result, this is the one of the best quarter because the profitability has increased tremendously, gross NPA and net NPA has reduced drastically, operating profit and net interest margin has also increased and as well as the PCR is also increased. So I will give you some idea of the whatever the — we have performed last quarter in the last financial year.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Gross business of the Bank increased by 12.14% to the tune of the INR11,65,000 crore. Then gross deposit increased Y-o-Y of 11.77% to the rupees — of INR12.81 lakh crore; gross advance increased by 18.68% at INR8,84,681 crore. Saving bank — there was a growth of around 2.72%, and stood at INR4,63,987 crore; and CASA share is 42.98%, and the RAM share out of the total advances is INR4,69,981 crore, which is 55.31%. Now come to the profitability part, the net interest income — there is a robust growth of 30.05% Y-o-Y, which used to be around INR7,304 crore in the last quarter of the ’21-’22 March quarter, has increased to INR9,492 crore for the quarter ended March 2023.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Similarly, the operating profit, there is an increase of around 11.42%. The operating profit for the March ’22 quarter was INR5,265 crore, which has increased to INR5,866 crore. As far as the net profit of the bank is concerned, net profit of the Bank in March 2022 was INR202 crore, which has increased to INR1,159 crore with a growth of 473.57%. As far as asset quality of the bank is concerned, quarter-by-quarter, there is an improvement in the asset quality and one more thing, important thing, every quarter from the June ’22 to March ’23, the recovery was much more than the addition. GNPA which used to be around INR92,448 crore as on the March 2022 has reduced to INR77,328 crore. And GNPA in terms of the percentage 11.78% March ’22 has reduced to 8.74% by March ’23.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Net NPA, which used to be around INR34,909 crores March ’22 reduced to INR22,585 crore; and net NPA which used to be 4.80% reduced to 2.72%. And we have given the guidance for the — 9% for the gross NPA, which reduced to 8.74%. Similarly, we had given the guidance for the 3% of the net NPA, which reduced to 2.72%. PCR, which used to be around 81.60% by the end of March ’22 improved to 86.90%. And one more thing is as I told you the recovery — and the recovery versus slippage. There was a lot of improvement in the recovery versus slippage. June quarter — June ’22 quarter, recovery was INR7,057 crore, which increased to INR8,565 crore in September and INR6,035 was in the December; and INR7,439 crore was in the March as against the target of around INR32,000 crore for all of the year.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"We have recovered INR29,096 crore as for slippage is concerned. Slippage is reducing quarter-by-quarter. In the first quarter, June ’22 slippage was INR6,468 crore, which reduced to INR5,979 crore in the September quarter, further reduced to INR4,072 crore in the December quarter and further it is reduced to INR3,996 crore in the March ’23 quarter. So Bank has done a very good — as far as the recovery of the asset quality is concerned. As far as capital adequacy is concerned, there is an increase of the 100 basis points in this year. It was 14.5% in the March ’22, which has increased to 15.50% and the Tier 1 which was 11.73%, increased to 12.69%. And cost of deposit, which was 4.15% in the December ’22, 3.97% in the March ’22 increased to 4.54%.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Yield on Advances has also improved, which was 6.80% in the March ’22 improved to 8.05% in the March ’23, and it was 7.35% in the December quarter last year ’22. And the cost to income ratio, there is an increase in the cost to income ratio from 56% — 46% to 54.59%. This is the major on account of the increase in the employee cost. Last quarter, March quarter, we have made a provision of INR278 crore for the wage revision, which is due from the November 2022. November and December, we have provided in December quarterly result. And AS-15, we have made a provision of INR1,244 crore, which includes the wage revision and the — factor of the wage revision on the gratuity as well as on the pension.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"We have also made a provision of PLI performance incentive of INR103 crores again — out of which INR79 crores was provided in the December quarter itself. Because as per the bipartite settlement, if improvement in the 5% in the OP, there in all the establishment for the 5 days PLI. So this is the reason of the increase in the cost to income ratio. As far as the NIM is concerned, NIM domestic is 3.38% and NIM global 3.24% as against the 2.86% in the March ’22 and 2.76% global NIM in the March ’22. AS-15, I have already advised. As far as provision for NPA is concerned, March ’23, we have made a provision of INR3,624 crore.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Credit quality is coming 1.72%. It was INR4,563 crore In the March ’22, which was around 2.45% as the credit cost. December ’22 figure was INR3,908 which is coming 1.87%. Whole of the year, for full year credit cost was 2.03%. As far as the RAM is concerned, as I told you, it was 51.23%, increased to 55.31%. OTR Restructuring, standard outstanding as of the OTR 1 is INR3,174 crore; OTR 2 is INR7,760 crore. As far as SMA-012 is concerned, SMA-012 in March ’22 was INR175,391 crore, which reduced to substantially in the December. And as on March ’23, the total amount is INR70,762 crore. Out of which INR850 crore in the SMA-2 only, and INR5 crore and above SMA 2 in March ’22 is hardly INR82 crore. As far as fresh slippage of INR3,996 crore is concerned, it is agri [Foreign Speech] around INR1,253 crore; MSME INR1,337 crore, retail INR660 crore; and others INR260 crore, existing INR478 crore.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"As far as our pricing on the credit portfolio is concerned, around 85.20% is the floating, which is based on the MCLR around 35%, RLR 26.39%, RLLR ELITE is 12%, and TBLR 10%. Fixed is hardly 7.16%, 4.3% in the foreign currency et cetera and the remaining 3.3% is the BS rate as well as the BPLR. One more thing I would highlight to all of you. This fresh underwriting, we have taken a lot of initiative for the improvement in the underwriting as well as improvement in the collection efficiency. I will give one data from the 1st of the July 2020 to March 31st 2023, around INR5,72,539 crore loan we have sanctioned. Out of which INR5,18,257 crore we have disbursed. INR4,16,638 crore is the outstanding, out of which the NPA is INR1,178 crore, which is coming around 0.23%. This you will get the — how the new underwriting standard is being done in the bank.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"The recovery from the NCLT in the last full year — first quarter was INR693 crore, quarter two was INR778 crore, quarter three was INR730 crore, last quarter, it was around INR1,000 crore. As far as investment is concerned SDMA around 79% is there. AFS is around 20% and modified duration of the AFS and the HFT portfolio is 2.53%. So this is my initial remarks to all of you. Now I would like to give answer of your questions. Thank you. Thank you. This — last year was very good. And I assure all of you ’23-’24 will be very good year for the bank. And I will give some guidance also. Credit growth, we are giving the guidance for the 12% to 13%, deposit growth we are giving the guidance 10% to 11%, and CASA share, we are giving the guidance around 43% to 44%. Net interest income, we are giving around increase 10%, and NIM will be around 2.9% to 3% because the repricing of the deposit has not taken place fully in the last year. Out of the loan — repricing has done immediately, but the repricing of the deposit has to take place.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Gross NPA, we are giving guidance, it will be less than 7%. Net NPA will be less than 2% and credit cost, which was around 2.03% last year, we are hopeful it will further reduce, it will be around 1.5% to 1.72%. And the target of the recovery for whole of the year will be a around INR22,000 crore.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,So this is my initial remarks. Thank you. Thank you very much.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,Questions and Answers:,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah. Thanks a lot, sir. So very strong set of performance the bank has given considering the raise in the margin on a sequential basis in the domestic margin. And also the asset quality has been quite good. Just one — couple of questions around on the margin side, sir. So CD ratio — domestic CD ratio is around 68% currently for the — for this quarter. So is there a scope to further increase the domestic loan deposit ratio from ASR because that would help us on the margin front?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"It was — if you see, it was around 69% as per our data. 69% was the CD ratio because we are having the excess SLR also, you all are aware. So, definitely, we would like to use. And without raising further deposit, even we will be in a position to improvement in the CD ratio in times to come.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Correct, sir. Correct. And sir, ROA guidance like that we have given for the FY’24 would be sir?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Return on assets — Return on assets, if you see, as on data is — because the profitability was less, so I think next year, I think, I will be in a position to give guidance of around, it should be around 50 or 60 — 0.50 or 0.60 basis point, yeah, percent.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Superb. Great. I would request Mr. Ajmera to unmute and go ahead with your question. Mr. Ajmera, please go ahead with your question.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"And — yes, compliments to Atul Sir — Goel Sir and the entire team for another set — I mean another good quarter — for the good set of numbers. Of course, the Bank has still — has to go a long way because of the some past negative legacy. Still our figures are not that very encouraging though, comparatively, yes, it is definitely better on many points, especially this — now — just now we discussed about the ROA. ROA of 0.32 in this quarter and 0.17 in the last quarter is very low and even the target also up 0.5 doesn’t inspire much.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"And similarly on some of the other data, if you look at though we are — your target for bringing the gross NPA down to 7% and net NPA to 2% is definitely encouraging. But finally, we would like the bank to come down below 5% in the gross and may be below 1% on the net NPA. Many of the peer banks have started coming down to net NPA at 0.7 or 0.5 or even 0.27, one of the small banks. Having said that, sir, what are our plans to bring down the credit cost? Credit cost is very, very high comparatively in our bank and still, I think the target is also not been given very encouraging. So what exactly the Bank is planning to bring the credit cost down, increase the ROE? And the write-offs are also very high, in this quarter, INR6,000 crore, in the overall year, INR16,578 crores. So going forward, what are our views on that? This is my first question on these three things combining.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Ajmera Ji, for the compliment. As far as your question is related to the credit cost, the credit cost in the last quarter was 1.72%. If you see the whole of the year, credit cost was around 2.03%. And we have already given the guidance, it should be within the range of 1.5% to 1.75%. And why we are giving this statement because you must have seen our quarterly number of the recovery as well as the reason. If you see the recovery quarter-by-quarter it is reducing. And recovery quarter-by-quarter increasing and the addition is reducing, because if I will give the number, the first quarter, June — you take the quarter of the June ’22.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"The recovery was INR7,057 crores. And the recovery was increased INR8,565 crores in September, and INR6,035 is in the December; and INR7,439 crore in the last quarter. So if you make the total, it was around INR29,000 crore against the very robust target last year, we have done for the INR32,000 crore.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Similarly, this addition is reducing quarter-by-quarter. First quarter of the last financial year it was — June INR6,468 crores. And September, it was INR5,979 crores. December, there was a steep fall, around INR4,072 crores. And in the last quarter also, it’s further reduced to INR3,996 crores. So if we are making more recovery and if we are — addition is reducing, so credit cost is bound to reduce because aging provision is also reduced because the 86% more than 86% we have PCR.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"So I do not foreseeing there will be — but your point is very right, although we are giving the guidelines for the gross NPA number 7%, 2% for the net NPA number, and you were saying other bank has come down less than the 5% or the 1%, the net NPA — I full fully agree with you. But because — only — if you see from the — from where we have started last year, 11.7%, we have reached to 8.7%. It means 3% we have reduced last year. And the — from the number of the gross NPA from the 4.80% to 2.72%. So last time we have done a very good job in the recovery and I’m hopeful this year will be very good for the recovery as far as the addition will be further reduced, and the credit cost, which I’m giving you the guidelines for the 1.52%. It will remain 1.5%.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"One more thing — because the I am giving the Return on Assets. Although I told, around 50 to 60 — 0.50% to 0.60%. But even if we see my net profit was around INR2,507 crores. And we are targeting it will be more than INR1,000 crore every quarter. So, if we take, it will be more than INR4,000 crore for the whole of the year. So even if I recalculate, so my return on asset will be around 0.40% to 0.42%, even we are giving the guidelines it will range between the — we will try to improve to 0.50. But I think when we are saying the target of the net profit, so I think you can take it 0.40 instead of 0.50. Yeah.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"No. I fully appreciate sir, I mean, after such a strong team led by you, definitely during your tenure, I mean things have been improved a lot. Yes, you are caring the past whatever is the negative legacy or whatever it is, you are definitely trying to improve the things. And we have lot of expectations from you and this team sitting here. Sir, now with this ECL now coming — now the guidelines are not 100% clear. But — is coming, is in offering. So the kind of report which you submitted to RBI or the kind of internal preparation, which you must have done, are you prepared for that without any shocks or without any negative effect going forward? Have you worked on the numbers? And have you made some provision on that, sir?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"[Foreign Speech] Ajmera Ji. I will give answer your question like this. Point number one, this guidance of the ECL, point number one is the draft guidance. And final guidance is likely to come. I think we should wait for the final guidance. And moreover in the draft guidance, what will be the requirement of the additional provision? The RBI has proposed they will give five years for this, because ultimately when we are talking about the ESL, it is on the — based on the expected credit loss. As of date, we are making the provision on the incurred loss basis, the account, which has turned to NP, we are making provision. But expected credit loss [Foreign Speech] ECL [Foreign Speech] expected credit loss.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"I have already given you the data of the last two and more than half year from the 1st July ’22 to till 31st March 2023, where I have already given how we are waving our new book, INR5.72 lakh crores we have sanctioned; INR5.18 lakh crore we have sanctioned. This was INR4.86 core is averaging where the gross NP number is 0.23 only, because this is the purpose of the underwriting standard only because ECL role is only for the underwriting. And role of the PCR is also in the ECL calculation because 81% to 86.90%, we have already read and CRA also — there is a 100-basis-point improvement from the March ’22, which was 14.50% to 15.50%. So considering all these things, I think there should not be any challenge whatever the guidance will be receiving from the RBI. We will definitely be ready for whatever the final guidelines will come.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"Sir, coming to that on how much buffer overall like standard provision structured — restructured book, COVID restructured book, other than the — what is recognized then as for RBI guideline and direct norms, what additional buffer or the provisions we have overall in the bank?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Ajmera Ji, ultimately [Foreign Speech] what I’m trying to tell, first, you are asking for the standard, what is the buffer in the standard? Point number one is that we should see how much buffer we are having in the NPA provision. [Foreign Speech] Last year it was 81%, it is around 87%. The standard provision — definitely, we have to provide as per the RBI guidelines. So, definitely, there is some buffer, which we have provided for the — as per the July 2019 circular. If the account will be resolved, this provision will be reversed in the last quarter also, because we have made a provision for the — standard provision for the some of the account, which was falling under the July 2019 circular, around INR500 crore, INR600 crore, was the around reversal in the March quarter itself. Even we are hopeful, even we’re hopeful full June quarter also because the account is under out of the visualization — definitely you can think this provision, which we have made, it will be — it is a buffer for us.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"My last question in this round is around treasury book. Treasury performance, of course, because of the upward trend going on till now, till March, performance is not good everywhere. There are some reduction in the profit, or it’s somewhere at losses also, MTM also. So in our case, how is our treasury book is placed? And how do we see now going forward when the rates are softening up or sub 7 now, 6.9, tenure. So can we get some color on the — our treasury performance in the coming quarters? And what are our — basically, our finance for that just then to make more profits?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"As far as our treasury, Ajmera Ji, our treasury is very active or we are having the good exposure in the investment side also. As your question is, because it is a movement of interest rate. Already interest rates further fallen, because if you see the tenure as you said, it was around 6.95 to 6.99 in four, five days also. And we have already provided mark-to-market, movement further interest rate will decrease, definitely, we can make the profit because we are earning profit on daily basis also with this yield of the 2.99%, and we are immunized also, because if there is a risk of the interest rate, because our modified duration is hardly 2.53% for the EFS as well as the HFT portfolio.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah. Ajmera ji, so can I request you to come back into the queue? There are other persons also waiting for the — with their queries?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"Oh, sure. Thank you. Thank you. I’ll come back. I’ll come back. Thanks for giving me so much of time. Thank you.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah. Hi, Bhavik, can you go ahead with your question? Yeah, Bhavik, please go ahead with your question.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Bhavik — — Analyst,"Hi, sir. Congrats on good set of numbers. So just three questions from my side. Sir, first of all as in, what would be the LCR ratio? And — hello?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Bhavik, go ahead. Your first question is LCR ratio. Yeah.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Bhavik — — Analyst,"Yes, sir. Sir, second question, sir. Sir, we saw a very strong quarter-on-quarter uptick in yields. So what drove that increase in yields? And is there any one-off there with respect to interest on income tax refund or some proportion of recovery from written-off accounts being a portion to the NII line?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Bhavik, first question is the LCR. LCR in the range of the 150%. It will keep on changing. It is within the range of the 150% to 160%. Your question is regarding the improvement in the yield. Improvement yield on the two, three count. So first count is the recovery. Not only the recovery in the technicality, it is not coming in the interest side, because if the — we are recovering more than the principle in the return, then only the part is coming to be interest income. But basically, there are — what is the USP of the bank, 43% we are having the CASA. That is the one of the reasons our NII growth is there, and the yield of advances is also increasing. So basically recovery has the main factor and even some of the account, if we are making 50 basis points, 25 basis points or so, we are not allowing the opponent to go. So this is the reason our yield of advances has increased.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Bhavik — — Analyst,"Okay. Understood, sir. And sir — so sir as in — so on the NII line as in for the full year, there is no interest portion from recovery from written-off, or there is some?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"There is no — there is — Bhavik, there is no — some portion is there, because we are getting the amount in the standard or doubtful category. If we are getting some money, we are also in the interest income. But your specific question was if some of the recovery on the technical written-off account was there — there was not there, but definitely interest income was very much there in the account, which will NPA and the — whatever the recovery we have made in the last year, INR29,000 crore we have recovered. The moment — it is just 8% to 9% again moment you are making the recovery. So it will start earning the interest income because as on date we are not earning anything out of it. So this is the reason recovery has contributed to the improvement in India.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Bhavik — — Analyst,"Understood, sir. And sir, how do we look at NIMs going forward, how much cost of deposits still see rising from here?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"[Foreign Speech] Bhavik, as far as yield of advance is concerned, 8.05% is the last quarter yield. So definitely — because some of the loan will be re-priced, which was earlier on the MCLR, their tenure is — as far as cost of the deposit is concerned, cost of deposit is 4.54% in the last quarter, it is bound to increase, because entirely pricing of the deposit will take at the time of the maturity of the term deposit. Because most of the deposit within the range of the one year to two year, so entire repricing of the deposit has not been affected. Definitely, in the next — current year ’23-’24, cost of deposit will definitely increase.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Bhavik — — Analyst,"Understood, sir. Sir, that’s it from my side.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"And as far NIM also — NIM also you asked. NIM [Foreign Speech] because the NIM was 3.38% in the last quarter, domestic and global was 3.24%. Because we are also envisaging the cost deposit will increase because the pricing — the pricing of the interest, which was linked on the REPO immediately done. So this is the reason we are giving the guidance for the next year, NIM will be between the range of 2.90 to 3.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Bhavik — — Analyst,"Understood, sir. Sir, thank you, sir. That’s it from my side.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Jai Mundhra — — Analyst,"Hello. Yeah, hi, sir.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,Yeah. Please go ahead sir.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Jai Mundhra, we are not in a position to hear. Rakesh, we are not hearing Jai Mundhra. Are you hearing?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah. I heard him, but now his voice is not coming.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Initially, I’ve also heard.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Jai Mundhra — — Analyst,"Sir, is this better now?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Jai, your voice is not clear. It is quite feeble. We can’t hear you well. Your voice is breaking in between. Can we move to the next participant? Kunal sir, please go ahead with your question. Kunal, please go ahead with your question. Kunal, are you there on the line? I think Kunal is not there. We will request Mr. Sushil Choksey to go ahead with your question.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,PNB for stable result. So what’s your credit pipeline visible in this current quarter?,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Credit pipeline as far as concerned, we have already told you growth we are envisaging 12% to 13% around INR1,00,000 crore. INR1,00,000 crore loan is the — already we have sanctioned. They are in the pipeline for the different — at various stages.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,Do you — are you seeing this more in infrastructure and corporate or you are seeing in some other sector?,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,It is a mix of — it is a mix of everything. It is a mix. Not only everything in the infra.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,"Sir, you highlighted that the treasury may have a substantial gain or a stable gain in coming quarters to come. Can you broaden the statement a little bit?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Hey, I just told the answer of the Ajmera Ji, up to last quarter. Because on account of increase in the yield, we were not in a position to make the treasury profit. Because, if you see the last quarter, from the March 2022 to March current date, March 23 [Foreign Speech] rate was 7.31%. If you see the 10-year G-Sec as on date, 6.98. [Foreign Speech] my answer was this, because already there is a reduction of around 32 — 33 basis points. By reducing of the 32, 30 basis point, some of this code — which were in the losses and the profit. So we can make profit also, because it is a moment of the interest rate game. 30 to 32 basis point is too reduction in the 10-year G-Sec from the March to till date.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,"Sir, my question was more directly related because the FED is more or less indicated that it is stopped out on interest rate, MPC has already indicated. Today, RBI’s remittance of dividend to central government has already triggered at INR87,000 crore, which maybe in surprise. So the borrowing plan so far, which people were thinking would be huge. It will have a impact on money market. Currently the short-term liquidity tightness may be there because of various factors led by RBI mopping of dollars, various maybe sector regions. But what I’m sensing, some of the peer banks have indicated that 10-year bond may head towards INR675 crore in the year-end. So one is — has the rate cycle peaked? Second thing is, are you seeing more credit in front-ended in the first half? And are you seeing a sustainable treasury profit in four quarters or you’re just seeing in Q1, Q2 itself?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"It is a matter of the booking also. Suppose I am sitting on the profit as on date — suppose let us take a hypothetical example, whatever you are saying is 6.7% by the end of the current financial year. Today is 6.98%. Suppose it is, as on date, 6.75%. I will be in the huge profit. So every profit I will not to book immediately. I will book the profit on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So it will be scattered on the quarter-to-quarter basis. And first, whatever the liquidity, if there is a liquidity issue whatever you are seeing some of this — if we are having the lesser yield, definitely we will sell, we will book the profit, and we will utilize that money for investing in the loan book, so that we can earn more profit. It is a mix of each and every thing. It is very difficult to answer whether you — when you will book, when you will — it depends on what is my liquidity position, what is the demand of the credit, everything is inter-related.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,"Sir, I’m not asking you whether you will book in Q1, Q2. I’m just asking an estimate whether you’re seeing front-ended profit or the second half. It’s okay, I’ll take up this question offline. Second thing, sir, what is the digital spend on the current year?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,What is that?,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,Digital spend — digital expenditure.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Digital last — digital, if you see the IT expenditure, last year, March 2022, it was INR1,750 crores as compared to INR1,170 crore, increase of 54.5%.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,"Thank you, sir, for answering all my questions. All the best to PNB team for future.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,Thank you. Thank you Sushil Ji.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah. Hi, Ajay. Please go ahead with your question. Ajay, please go head with your question. I think, again, there is some issue in his line. Ashlesh, please go ahead with your question.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,"Can you talk about the slippages that we are seeing? We saw 2% gross this quarter, still equally higher as compared to [Indecipherable]",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Slippage, if you see quarter-by-quarter, there is a reduction in the slippage. In the last quarter, it was in the range of the INR4,000 crore. It was less than INR4,000 crore. And quarter-by-quarter, we are of due — definitely, there will be a reduction in slippage.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,[Indecipherable],PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,Your voice is not clear.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Rakesh, voice is — we are not in a position to hear.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,Yeah. I also —,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,Is it better sir?,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah, it is better now. Please continue.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,"Yeah. So I was talking about the recoveries. You have guided for INR22,000 crores for FY’24. Any chunky accounts that you expect recoveries over here?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"It is a — it is a — it is a mix of all — mix of all. I can give you some of the — for the quarter one and quarter two what we are expecting from the NCLT. First quarter, we are estimating — it is estimation, around INR500 crore plus from the first quarter, and second quarter, we are hopeful around INR1,300 crores plus will be the recovery from the NCLT. So it is a mix of all. It is a small account also. Some money will come from the sale of the securities through auction, some money will come through the OTS also. And we have also floated one scheme e-OTS, that is we are the unique in the industry.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"And this e-OTS, the applicable for the amount, less than INR10 lakh. As on date, we are having good number of account, INR11,000 — 11 lakh account of INR11,000 crore eligible. Last year, we have recovered around INR900 crore from this e-OTS. Customer is not required to visit. They can make the payment sitting at their home, and after making their payment, it is NDND scheme, non-discriminatory and non-discretionary. They are not required to negotiate also and after making the payment they can generate the no due certificate from the mobile app only.",PNB,Punjab National Bank

Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"We can’t hear you, Ashlesh. Your line is not clear to us.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,Is this better?,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,Now better.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,Yeah. [Indecipherable],PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,Your voice is breaking. I would request you to go to a better reception area because we are not — we can’t hear your voice.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,[Indecipherable],PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Sir, I think he is asking for the breakup of slippage, sir.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Breakup of the slippage, I can give you the breakup of the slippage for the last quarter. The agri is around INR1,253 crores, MSME INR1,337 crores, Retail is INR660s, Others is INR268 crores and existing account it was INR478 crores. So INR3,996 crore, I can give it you for full year also. Maximum slippage for them only. Agreement for all of the year INR6,542 crore. MSME, it was INR5,836 crore. Retail, it was INR2,126 crore, and the remaining was INR7,062 crore, and the existing was INR3,178 crore.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,"So, talk about [Indecipherable] INR270 crores as well the bipartite type.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Provision. Yeah. You’re asking slippage for the next year or this year also, Rakesh, because their voice was not clear.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,Wage related provision that you’ve made this quarter.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I will tell you. Wage revision, we have made INR278 crore provision in this current quarter. Last quarter also, we have made a provision of INR181 crore. In addition to this, AS provision INR1,244 crore, which is also having the impact of the wage revision.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,Okay. Perfect.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Could I request Kunal to go ahead with your question? Kunal, please go ahead with your question. Yeah, Kunal, please go ahead. We can’t hear you Kunal. Yeah, Mr. Ajmera Ji, would you like to go ahead with your question now?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"Thank you for giving the opportunity again. Many of the questions have already been answered by Atul Ji. But just some — just discussions since I got the opportunity. One thing is that it’s a point of basically a complement only. If you see the — most of the other peer banks, the employee cost has gone up because of these two, three provisions, and also maybe the performance-linked bonus and other things. At least 10% to 20%, the employee cost has gone up in this quarter, but in your case its hardly gone up by — hardly INR100 crore.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"Employee cost INR4,570 crores compared to INR4,460 crores. Similarly, the other operating expenses also in your case has gone up by only INR140 crores. So what is the, basically, what have you done? I mean, what is that all possible provisions which are required have been made — you already said about the wage revision that the provisions have been made as far as the additional pension which was already made in the last year. Any increment? So how this magic happened that — total employee cost and the operating cost has been under so much of control.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"No, operating costs [Foreign Speech] operating cost is under control, no doubt about it, because there is no much into the other operating expenditure. But whatever you are saying is payment to employee. If you see the March ’22 data, I think you are not seeing data, please. March ’22, the employees cost was INR2,158 crore only, which has increased to INR4,570 crore in the March ’23. It is basically double. There is no magic. There is double. If you see the whole of the — whole of the year also — whole of the year, ’21-’22, the employee cost was INR11,841 crore, which has increased to INR14,810 crore.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"So employee cost definitely in the tune with the other bank has increased. And we have also made a provision, as I told you, from the November to March, INR278 crore in this last quarter, INR181 crore in the December quarter. And there was a lot of provision for the AS-15 also INR1,244 crore we have made in the provision in the last quarter March, similar provision was in the December also. Otherwise, this provision used to remain within the range of the INR500 crore to INR600 crore. [Foreign Speech] Ajmera Ji.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"So sir, we generally — once we finish the quarterly discussion, we concentrate more on the quarterly performance only. So I was comparing only with the December quarter and the March quarter. In that, there is hardly any increase?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. You are very much right. You are very much right. December or March, there was no much difference. But December vis-a-vis September or the March 2022, it was doubled. We are worried how to reduce the employee cost.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"No. So what I was actually drawing the point to — is that, in the coming quarters now, whether it is going to remain around the same INR4,500 crore, INR4,600 crore the employees cost and the other operating expenses about INR2,500 crores, so that we can have some idea about the future quarters or is there anything coming there?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Ajmera Ji, basically the employee cost major factor is one account of the AS-15 provision as well. And if you see the 10-year G-Sec momentum, there is a very volatile. I will give you the — March ’21, it was 6.18. March ’22, it was 6.84, March ’23, 7.31. And currently, as on date, it is hovering around 6.95 or 6.96. So basically, if there is a reduction in the 10-year G-Sec AS-15 provision immediately increases. If there is a hardening in the interest rate, AS-15 provision reduces. So sometimes it depends on the moment of the interest rate also.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Now, some things around this NARCL, what is the status there? How many accounts? Whether any account has been settled during this last quarter, January-March, or it’s in offing? What is the status there, sir?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Ajmera Ji, as far as in our bank, NARCL is concerned, around 38 accounts for INR17,658 crore under discussion. Out of this, one account of INR447 crore, we have already assigned to NARCL. Another two accounts also, we have sold to the NARCL, but later on some other ARC, they have increased the rate, which they have not mailed — two accounts sold to the other ARC. In addition to 38 accounts, which I told you, around 35,000 accounts is also under discussion for an amount of INR16,892 crore, where exposure of the banking sector is more and more than INR500 crore and in these 35 accounts we are the lead bank.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"Okay. So, many of these resolutions are expected in the coming year now, isn’t sir?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,Yeah. Definitely.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"And, sir, this INR447 crore, which had been done in March, you must have received the SR for the 85%, which is government-guaranteed SR.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,Yeah.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"So the SRs are also put in SRs and provided for 100% or a separate treatment — a different treatment is given to, like suppose the INR447 crore account just must have been settled for about INR100 crore or something. So you must have received about INR80 crore, INR85 crores of SRs. I’m just guessing, I don’t have the exact number. But for example — so what treatment to this SR has been given ended your SRs of INR1,518 crores that include this SR also, and whether it is the entire amount has been 100% provided for?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. And — this is the in addition to debt whatever the other SR available as on date, that — 100% we have provided. This is a very small amount and treatment is same. Only the difference in this code we received is different because they are being government-guaranteed and they are being treated in the market also. The amount was very less in this account. Yeah.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,Okay. But you will be giving the same treatment like any other SR providing?,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,Yes. You are right. On the basis of the NAVR.,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"Sir, last if time permits is on your CASA. Every bank’s little bit decline is there in the CASA in the last quarter because people are opting for more of the term deposits. So going forward, do you have any specific plan or some scheme or something to increase the CASA of the bank? Because you are at a comfortable level, in fact, and you can go still further, Punjab National Bank being a National Bank, a Pan-India bank very, very old bank. So whether any plan, anything is in place?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Ajmera Ji, [Foreign Speech] I will tell you. This is one of the focus areas and this is the USP of the Punjab National Bank. As on date, if you see, 43% is the around the CASA of the Bank. And we are having the 16 crore customers. And we are trying to increase the new acquisition in ’21-’22 around 71.33 lakh accounts we have opened, which has increased in the last year, ’22-’23, 85.02 lakhs. We are providing a facility — we have provided TAP. We have provided all the 10,000 branches where they can open their account within one day earlier because the branches were getting the document, they were sending to the back office. It was sometimes — sometimes it was taking three days, four days, sometimes it takes 15 days also because they’re raising the query. So after this implementation of the providing of the TAP, this process of the new acquisition has become very good, and we are hopeful next year definitely we will increase a substantial number of the — not only VISA also the card also.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ajmera — — Analyst,"Thank you very much, sir. And all the best to you. With such a strong team, I think you will deliver more than what you are promising. Thank you.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you. Thank you, Ajmera Ji.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah. Ashlesh, do you have any more questions? Yes. Please go ahead. Ashlesh, do you have any more questions? Mr. Choksey, do you have any other questions to the management? Please go ahead.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,"Sir, can you highlight something on your subsidiaries? What is your plan going forward as that maybe bringing in good benefit to the PNB?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"The subsidiary, I think, as on date, there is no plan to sale of the — any equity in the subsidiary, as on date, no plan.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,And I’m not asking for —,PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"We — actually we want to increase the valuation of the subsidiary rather than to sale the subsidiary because all the — most of the subsidies we are getting the dividend and et cetera. As on date, there is no plan on sale of the — sales invested in the subsidiary.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,"So, sir, I’m not asking for sale of any holding from any other subsidiaries. But as times may get better with PNB Housing, MetLife, and various other arms, the profits can shore up and support on cross-selling between PNB customer base and company. And that is the reason I ask you about digital spend. I suppose, as on today, you’re not even penetrating 2% or 3% or 4% of your customer base with your products. Can it go to 5%? Like yesterday, in one of your peer large banks, they had aspiration for $1 billion of other income. Do we have some number? And what kind of cross-sell will we do for our products and external products?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. You are very much right. Definitely, we are taking all these terms how to improve the working of the subsidiary of the associates also, so that whatever the dividend et cetera we are getting, that should be improved. So my balance sheet in the consolidated number will also increase. And we will also utilize this subsidiary for the other purpose also. We are having one of the subsidiaries where we have got the approval from the regulator to do other activity also, which will be beneficial for the Bank. We will use that subsidiary as our marketing again for generating the lead for the housing, generating the lead for the — even for the retail side also.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Sushil Choksey — — Analyst,"Thank you for answering my questions, sir.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Sir, there are some questions which are the chat box. Firstly, starting through the question from Jai Mundhra, breakup of INR70,700 crore SMA number into SMA 0, 1, 2, if you can provide the breakup, sir?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, I can provide the breakup. Out of the INR70,762 crore, the SMA 0 is INR52,622 crores, SMA 1 is INR17,290 crores, and SMA 2 is the INR850 crore. The maximum is the SMA 0 only. There is a — accounting issue also — we are also addressing.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Got it, sir. Second question is from Kunal sir with respect to EBLR or MCLR and fixed route book breakup that is already there in the presentation. So the second question from Kunal sir is pertaining to the behavior of MSME restructured portfolio, if you can elaborate, sir, please?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"The MSME in OTR, when I will give you the — only for the MSME. OTR [Foreign Speech] around is implemented was INR670 crore, the standard [Foreign Speech] outstanding is INR343 crore. And if you see the OTR 2 also — OTR 2 [Foreign Speech] the MSME was around outstanding is INR4,587 crores, out of which is standard is INR2,657 crore. Some of the account definitely in the OTR 1 and OTR 2 also, has moved to the NPA, out of this OTR 2 around INR1,931 crore was the NPA.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"And sir, I missed the total provision on the restructured book that we have sir, standard restructured book, total provision that we have.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Total provision on the standard book, it includes the — if you’re asking the OTR 1 — OTR 1 and OTR 2 [Foreign Speech] we have already given in the Note 2 accounts, it is 10% of the outstanding. But restructuring is — there is some provision also, which we have to make the provision as per the 7 July 2019 circular also. Although that is not the structure, but we have to make a provision also.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay. Thanks. And sir, one thing I noticed compared to higher deposit growth number on a Y-o-Y basis, NDTL growth is around 7%. So have we reduced — like the borrowings from the book? Or what is the reason for lower growth in the NDTL on a Y-o-Y basis as compared to deposit growth?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"NDTL actually — actually it is the combination of the deposit and the other liabilities also. So maybe some of the other liabilities have reduced, but normally it keep on changing on the quarterly basis also, because some part of the deposit on the bulk side also. So it keep on changing also.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, there is a question from Bhavik pertaining to the guy SMA details.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"Rakesh, from where you have taken this data of the NDTL? If you see the NDTL is on the same line. I am not seeing any difference. If you see my December ’22 number, it was INR11,52,000 crore. And even if you see the March ’23 number, INR11,75,000 crore. So from where you were seeing there is a difference? So it is not decreasing. You’re seeing the decreasing?",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"No, it is not decreasing, sir. In the slide number 16 sir, you have given investment portfolio and the NDTL number where the Y-o-Y variation is 6.93. And if I look at deposit growth number, that is global deposit number —",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Atul Kumar Goel — Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,"The 11% — you’re comparing with the deposit number also. 11% itself — average — sometimes it is on average basis also, because if somebody increasing the deposit in the last, that is also it. Yeah.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"Got it. Correct. Got it, sir. Ashlesh, do you have a question? Your hand is raised. Do you have a question Ashlesh, please go ahead.",PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Ashlesh — — Analyst,[Indecipherable],PNB,Punjab National Bank 
Rakesh Kumar — Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. Ltd. — Analyst,"I think that is all from our end, sir. I think there is no more questions. There is no more questions, sir, from our end. I think we are done with the questions and there is no further query.",PNB,Punjab National Bank

Archana Gude — Analyst,"Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the Q4 FY ’23 Earnings Conference Call of JK Paper Limited. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"I’d like to welcome Shri A.S. Mehta, President and Director; Shri Veerappan KR., Chief Financial Officer; Shri Ashok Gupta, Senior VP, Finance and Accounts of JK Paper. I thank you for giving us this opportunity to host the earnings call.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"I shall now hand over the call to the management for the opening remarks. Over to you, sir.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts","Thank you, Archana ji. So, I will request Mr. Veerappan to read the financials, and then Mr. Mehta.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,Do you want to put the presentation?,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts","So, Archana ji, that we have already uploaded the presentation, we will not go through the presentation. Can we directly go to the financials if…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Sure, sir. Let’s do.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. Good evening, all. Of course, the presentation — as Ashok mentioned, presentation has been already uploaded. I am sure all of you would have seen. But we thought we’ll just take 5 minutes, 10 minutes to just briefly go through on the important points. And then we will open the session for the question and answers.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"JK Paper service performance for the last year ’22-’23 has been a great year. And you can see from the results, it’s been a phenomenal year. Just a few points. The capacity utilization was at 103.9% against 100% last year. And the turnover is the highest ever, which is then the results — published results. And one important thing which happened last year was acquisition of two companies in Corrugated Packaging business. And both the companies put together, they have around seven plants across the country. So that’s been one fill in the gap [Phonetic] in the last year.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"And of course the trust on the plantation activities continues. Last year alone around INR8.32 crores saplings have been planted covering 55,700 acres. And we continue to be the wood and carbon positive company. Just one information I would like to make, we are proud to say that the company has covered so far around 6 lakh acres of plantation and we have planted already over 110 crore saplings till date, right from the beginning. And last year, few new products have been introduced like JK Eco-green Purefil and Tuff Freeze, P2P.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"As regards credit rating, our — I think, JK Paper is the first company to have upgraded — getting into the AA rating from AA minus stable, we’ve got upgraded to AA. And our subsidiary — by both the agencies CRISIL as well as India Ratings. And our subsidiary, Sirpur, has also — has been upgraded two notches in this year from A positive to AA minus positive.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, the financials are there in front of you. The volume details are there and the revenue and EBITDA margin fourth quarter was around 29.8%, full year 33.1%. So there is an increase of 5.6% over last year. And this gives the yearly trend and this year has been a phenomenal year and from INR4,244 crores, we have moved to INR6,772 crores and you can see the rise in EBITDA also from INR1,122 crore to INR2,184 crore and so the PBT and PAT. And for the first time, last year we did INR544 crore PAT delivered and now it’s more than double in one year. It’s already — of course, we have crossed the INR1,000 crore milestone, but not only INR1,000 crore, we have crossed INR1,200 crores, INR1,208 crore is the PAT delivered last year.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, these are the continuous improvements you can see on the various parameters in terms of the interest rates and ROCE. We are right now at 21.1% post-tax. And the borrowing situation, the cash situation has been healthy. We have been reducing the net debt constantly. At this point of time, at the consolidated level, we are at around INR1,900 crores of net debt. The net debt to equity is less than 0.5 and net debt to EBITDA is less than 0.1, we’re at 0.89. So these are the volume jumps. Volume has already gone from right from 2005, if you see the journey, and from 2020, there has been a significant jump.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Now let’s just complete.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. I think rest, by and large, we have covered, so Mehta ji, would you like to say anything more before we open to question and answers.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Sure, sure, sure. So, you want to continue the presentation.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts","Yes, we can continue or remove it. [Speech Overlap]",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Then stop this.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts",I’ll request Mr. Mehta ji to say a few words and then we can open the session for question and answers.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Very good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining this call. In fact, the year ’22-’23 has been very favorable market as well as a good year for the paper industry. I would say that the ’22-’23 has been the outlier year for the industry in many, many ways. The demand was robust. Also the global pulp prices were very high. So the integrated player, those are in the country, most player are the integrated player. So since the pulp prices were higher, paper prices globally were higher. So we got the advantage of the higher NSR. So the volume, NSR both played a positive factor for the much improved performance during the year.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Also during the year, our new packaging board capacity, which we could utilize up to 90%, because the strength of the market and the demand in the market. So that also played a significant role. And also [Technical Issues] in fact from our Sirpur point of view, because after acquisition, this is the second year of the full running of the plant and there also we could produce close to 90% of the capacity. And when the market was favorable, in fact, whatever we produce, we could sell at a good price and that’s the reason that at Sirpur we clocked somewhere around INR300 crore plus the PAT which is phenomenal, I mean if you think about the company of 1,30,000 ton of capacity.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"And also when there is a sentiment about the replacing the plastic, so there is a good moment as far as we are concerned for the packaging material. So this is on the paper side. Of course, there were challenges because of the commodity prices, because of the energy prices, but somehow we could recover from the market and we were fairly comfortable.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Also during the year, all the operating parameters also we did very good. And the acquisition, the Corrugation business, because we entered into this business. So our Ludhiana plant, the erection and commissioning were a per schedule. And the top of it, the icing on the cake was the acquisition of the India’s number one corrugation these two companies put together.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"And in the quarter four where this was consolidated in our results, broadly they were in line with what was projected. So this is all about and yes the market is likely to be volatile in coming days. But the strength of JK Paper and the whole — the team what we have, we should outperform the industry again in time to come.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Thank you. Now, I mean, we can address all the question, and the house can be open.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Questions and Answers:,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Sure. Thank you so much, sir, for this presentation and your words. Let’s start the Q&A session. We have Harsh Shah as the first speaker. Harsh, please go ahead.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Harsh Shah — L&T Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Yes. Thank you very much. Congratulations to the team for such a successful year. I just have few questions on the Q4 results, and then I have couple of questions on the way going forward. Firstly, on Q4, can you just explain in terms of the margin variations that we are seeing on a quarter-on-quarter basis, firstly, on gross margin and, I guess, there is a bit of high elevated other expenses. Was there any one-off in this quarter?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Okay. I mean, I would suggest that please put all your questions, so that those can be addressed in one go.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Harsh Shah — L&T Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Sure. Sure, sir. Second is again towards the Q4 result only, you mentioned that we have acquired both corrugated packaging companies in this year. So is there any numbers that you can give like in terms of this quarter? Has those two companies contributed anything to your revenue and also to your margins, bottom line, etc.? Those were the two questions that I had on Q4 results.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Harsh Shah — L&T Mutual Fund — Analyst,"And then just going forward, in one of the interviews Mr. Veerappan said that company intends to achieve INR7,000 crore of turnover next year. Can you just also help us understand? Of course, there has been volatility in pulp prices, we are seeing that globally. But in terms of margins, where you will be profitability, we have clocked INR1,200 crores. Will it be similar? Will it be lower? If lower, what is the variation that internally you guys are planning?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Harsh Shah — L&T Mutual Fund — Analyst,"And last question, that is again on strategy level guys. In terms of scaling up the businesses that you have acquired, what is the plan going forward? How big can it just be businesses and how a consolidated JK Paper will look like after full integration of those two acquired businesses also? So these were the broad four questions I had.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. Your question on Q4 margin variation, I think we have mentioned, Mehta ji had also mentioned and we’d also, there has been a little bit of a price drop in the Coated Paper and the Packaging Board. And as far as the other expenses are concerned, I think, if I’m not wrong, you are seeing the consolidated number. And consolidated this time we have the two companies Horizon Packs and Securipax Packaging expenses also added in that expenses. So that’s why compared to last year, it looks higher. Otherwise, it’s just a consolidation impact. And as far as the numbers on Corrugated Packaging business is concerned, in Q4 we have delivered around INR190 crores topline. And overall, if you see in the consolidation, it’s around INR228 crores topline or INR231 crores and bottom line will be in the range of INR23 crores.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"All right. As far as your question on the turnover or outlook for ’23-’24 and also the Corrugation business, I would say that on a full year consolidation basis, the Corrugation business should give close to INR1,100 crore of turnover and EBITDA of INR100 crore to INR120 crore, depending on what kind of craft — paper prices trend remains in the market in coming year. So that’s one part. And if we consolidated on a full year for craft, I mean the Corrugation business and the paper and packaging board business, we should be close to INR7,000 crore to INR7,500 crore as our topline. Does it answer…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Harsh Shah — L&T Mutual Fund — Analyst,"And consolidated margins, sir? Like consolidated profitability that EBITDA…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Margin, it is difficult at this stage, because see please understand Corrugation business will give EBITDA margin of something around 10% to 16% depending on which period are we in. Because sometime the — right now, if you ask me, the EBITDA margin is 12% to 14% in this industry. And in time to come when you utilize the capacity better, it could be fell to 16% EBITDA in the Corrugation business. And the Paper business, I would say that the price volatility will be there and commodity volatility will remain in ’23-’24. So it’s very difficult, but I can only tell you that the margin of ’22-’23 will not be there in ’23-’24.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Harsh Shah — L&T Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Understood, sir. That was very helpful. And just lastly and just one other thing that you mentioned earlier, if you have to going forward, see JK Paper standalone, that will be a pure paper business and consolidated will have packaging. Is that the right way to see or how Sirpur will be accounted for?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"No, Sirpur is also consolidated and Sirpur is purely a paper company, right. And the JK Paper is also Paper and Packaging Board. And the consolidated, certainly, you will have a corrugation business. So that’s very simple. I mean something around INR6,000 crore plus will come from paper and INR1,100 crore, INR1,200 crore will come from the corrugation business.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Harsh Shah — L&T Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Understood, sir. Sir, that was really helpful. Thank you and all the very best.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Thank you.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Thank you, Harsh. Next we have Deepak Lalwani. Sir, please go ahead.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Yes, hi. Thank you, gentlemen, for taking the questions. Sir, my first question, if I heard you right, the corrugated paper contribution in this quarter was INR190 crores topline and INR23 crores PAT, right?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"No, no. I mentioned about EBITDA, INR190 crore topline in Q4 and around INR18 crores EBITDA in Q4. Overall year — we had December also some 20 days, so overall year, it’s around INR23 crores EBITDA.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,Okay. And what will be the contribution to PAT?,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,Contribution to PAT is about INR4 crore.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"INR4 crores, okay. And sir, since although we are early in this business, any learnings you would want to share with us? And the way for the business going forward, as to how you would, sort of, ramp up and come to the profitability guidance that you have?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See, the corrugation business and as you rightly said that this is too early for us, because we are also learning this business. And every day, there is some new learning for us in this business. But I would say that we have a good team in that business. And the erstwhile promoter, they are still continuing with us and they are contributing in a very, very positive manner. So we have a good mix of team, some of the people coming from JK Paper business and the existing or the erstwhile promoter they are continuing. And also we have recruited some more people in the Corrugation business. So going forward, there will be a good mix of professional people, and also those older people. But I am confident that we have a good team and this business should do better in time to come. See, the learning is that, in that rate, you need to have a very strong relationship with the customer. And once you have a good customer acquisition, your capacity utilization goes up and that adds good value for the business.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Right. Got it, sir. And in your comments to earlier participant you mentioned that there is a correction in the quarter and the packaging prices. And you also see that the China pulp prices have been — have corrected quite a bit. So, any short-term guidance if you would want to give on the realization and any cost levers — do we have any cost levers to sort of protect our EBITDA per ton that you make? Any comments on that?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See, I would say that, the paper industry EBITDA margin, I would say that if it remains in the band of 20% to 25%, it is a decent EBITDA margin. So — and that gives a healthy ROCE also, if the EBITDA is 20% to 25%. And I would say that right now also even the coated paper prices have come down, packaging board prices have come down. But at the same time the pulp required, mechanical pulp required for packaging board has also come down sharply, I mean, from a $900 a ton, it has already touched $500 a ton. So that also gives an advantage. So going forward, if we are able to have something around 25% margin, there is a very decent margin and we should be happy with that kind of a margin. As I said that the 2022-’23 has been an outlier year, and we can’t expect kind of a margin over 35% or a 40% margin in time to come.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Right, sir. Got it. And how much has been the price drop, if you can give us the range in both the segments?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See in the coated paper, price drop has been close to 20% and the packaging board prices have also come down by 10% to 12%.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Sure, sure. And sir, if you can indicate the utilization levels in our packaging plant and the Sirpur unit? And any guidance for the volume growth in FY ’24 will be useful?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See, both these plants are operating at 90%, packaging board new machine, as well as the Sirpur. And in fact, we have already touched some 90% plus now and hopefully in this year, maybe after the second quarter, we should be operating at 100% at both the facilities.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Got it. After this price drop, do you expect any further correction or do you think for the next two quarters, three quarters, we are done with this sort of correction?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See very difficult at this stage, because entirely it will depend upon the global — pulp price trend I know and slightly this may be higher pulp prices later on, because pulp price anything below $550 is not right price for the pulp manufacturer, because their cost of production and the other issues. So a sustainable pulp prices would be in the band of $525 to $575 or $600. So if at this level, it’s not a sustainable price level for the pulp manufacturer also. So if the pulp prices goes up again, then there will be opportunity for a stable output prices as well as there may be some opportunity to correct the prices again northwards. But it will remain very volatile in this year ’23-’24.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Understood, sir. Sir, lastly on your balance sheet, any targets you have on the debt repayment for ’24?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts",The normal repayment whatever that we have scheduled that will continue and we are also exploring that if some high cost debt can be prepaid. So [Indecipherable] the repayment will be about INR450 crores.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,It’s INR500 crore. Consolidated level around INR500 crore plus — INR500 crores to IN540 crores will be repaid.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts","That’s the repayment normal, but certainly that we are keeping that interest cost also in mind. So wherever you find that opportunity to pre-pay that we will continue to do so.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Deepak Lalwani — Unifi Capital — Analyst,"Sure. I have more questions, but I’ll join back in the queue. Thank you.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you, Mr. Lalwani. Next we have Amit Doshi from Care PMS. Sir, please go ahead.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Amit Doshi — Care PMS — Analyst,"Yes. Sir, you mentioned yesterday in an interview that this wood procurement cost is increasing. So can you just share some thoughts around that, what is it and how it’s impacting us?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"All right. See the wood procurement cost is increasing because the wood — the requirement has gone up because of two factors, one is the MDF and plywood. When the construction industry is doing better than the requirement of and the demand of plywood and MDF goes higher and they need additional wood. And since they don’t do plantation, so the pressure comes on the plantation done by the paper industry. So, in fact, in Northern part of the country, as well as in the Western part of the country, prices moved up substantially. And later on the impact also was felt in the Southern part of the country. So there is an increase in the wood cost.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"At the same time also there is a linkage with the MSP announced for the food grains. Because the farmer will always compare their income stream with other crops. So if they get better reward in doing a cotton or a paddy or a wheat or sugarcane or any other crop, they will have a shift from plantation to the crop. So we need to keep all the time in mind that what kind of a revenue I am able to generate for a farmer. So that is why there is an increase in the wood cost.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Yes, wood cost increase will have an impact on the profitability. So in fact last year alone in the Western part of the country price increase was substantial. It was more than 25%. But in the Northern part and Southern part, it was decent, it was something around 6%, 7% or so. But we have — it was, okay, because the output prices we could increase and we could recover from the market, so this was fine. See the present raw material costs also and present prices in the market, I mean these are all manageable and find no issue at all at this point of time. But if the output prices goes much below, then it will start hitting the paper industry.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Amit Doshi — Care PMS — Analyst,"Okay, okay, okay. Got it, got it. Sir, in terms of our NSR, what has been our NSR for Q4 and Q3? And this question is because we don’t have that topline breakup in the PBT that you have given. So we are not able to understand. And second, the question linked to it is, this — the global pulp price you mentioned came down from $900 in August ’22 to say $500 now, which is not sustainable. But broadly, how they are linked? So if the global pulp prices are down by 40%, would our NSRs also come similarly down by 40% or what, if you can just explain that linkage as well along with the numbers?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Global pulp prices and the NSR, there is not a direct link, sometime and — see in the long run, there has to be a linkage between a pulp price and a paper price. You understand that many a times that linkage is broken, because ultimately it is the demand and supply of the output, not the pulp. So if the demand and supply of the paper is fairly balanced or if the demand is more than the supply, then irrespective of the pulp price, the paper price would be different.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"But at the same time, if the supply is more and demand is less, irrespective of the pulp price, the paper prices were be lower. That we have seen in the past also. Our general understanding of the paper industry is that if the pulp is X, the paper prices should be $250 X plus. This is the general understanding. So if the long-term — the trend, if somebody plot the long-term, I mean, you will find a delta of $200 to $250 depending on the energy cost. At the current energy cost, the delta can be as high as $300. So if the pulp price is $500, paper prices should be in the band of $800. And as long as the demand supply again, this will play a role, so that’s the factor.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Amit Doshi — Care PMS — Analyst,"Okay, okay. And if you can share NSR of Q4 versus December?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"I think the NSR we don’t share, because it is — to my mind, this is the number I don’t want to talk on the NSR because this is one area where we want to be slightly…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts",Which is [Indecipherable] indicated about the trend. So I think that should be sufficient enough because it is a mix and as well as various combination into that. So that has grew by that trend.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Amit Doshi — Care PMS — Analyst,"Sure, sure, sure. Sir, regarding corrugated business, so this Ludhiana plant, when it is likely to come on-stream and kind of contribute to our topline, bottom line? And in terms of the raw material procurement chain that we — such a strong change that we have in our paper business. So in corrugated, how comfortable we are in terms of our raw material availability and no stuff like that?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See, the Ludhiana plant, the trials are going on and because you understand that it takes time because we — erection and commissioning were there and it was done sometime in October, November, December and thereafter the trials were going on, because sometime it takes time because we were new. Also the workers we recruited they were untrained people. So we were training the workers. The machine supplier, they were also stabilizing the machine.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Broadly now, some part is stable but there are still one teething issues are bothering us. Hopefully by next month, we should be able to stabilize the machines. And also one major equipment one, which was delayed because of the zero COVID policy China and some supplies from China to the machine suppliers were impacted. So, in fact, we are likely to get that machine sometime in June. So, once that machine is installed, then only we will get a sizable production from Ludhiana facility. So, hopefully, in next two months, three months time, we should be up and running the Ludhiana plant at a decent level.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Amit Doshi — Care PMS — Analyst,"Okay, okay, okay. And sir, you mentioned about INR540 crore of debt repayment. I believe, even if we have say a 20% margin next year with INR7,000 crore topline, we will have close to INR1,000 crore or plus cash generation. So what could be a priority in terms of utilization of that additional INR450 crores of cash, I mean presuming things happened this way.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Building the war chest, so that in future we can do something more.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Amit Doshi — Care PMS — Analyst,"Okay, okay, okay. Got it. Yes, I think, I have more, but I think I’ll join the queue. Thank you so much. And wish you all the very best and really appreciate the higher dividend that you announced.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Thank you.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Thank you, Mr. Doshi. Next we have Tushar Verma. Sir, please go ahead.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Tushar Verma — — Analyst,"Yes. Hi, sir. Very good afternoon. Actually I have three questions in total. My first question is what is the current prices of paper board and uncoated paper as compared to Q4 FY ’23 and to average of Q4 FY ’23 actually? And my second question is, what is the reason for the sharp increase in finance costs from Q2 to Q4, that is we can see from INR36 crore to INR63 crores, respectively? And my last, and final question is, why are we not buying back the shares companies generated so much of cash and share value is so low? Thank you, sir. That’s all from my side.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"See as far as the finance cost is concerned, we have a forex ECB loan of around INR85 million and we do — as per the Ind AS, we need to do a reinstatement of these liabilities. At 30th September, the euro-rupee was at INR80.11 and 31st March it has gone up to INR89.61. So that’s the reason that reinstatement liability has been booked. It’s more of a book entry, if you see the loan tenure, we are by and large, there is not much of a gain or loss. But yes, period-to-period, based on the accounting entry based on Q2 to Q4 there is a move.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts","So you have to calculate considering the — whatever that we are reported as interest figure versus that whatever that average loan outstanding. So, you will get the correct picture of that, what is that average rate of interest, which comes to close to 7.4%, 7.5%.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,There was one more.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,He asked coated paper price.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"As I said that the coated paper and the packaging board price drop, I have said. And as I said that the NSR product wise we don’t want to give in the public domain, because we don’t publish. So this is one part. Any other…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,The future cash…,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"The future cash, I would say that as I already said, whatever cash surplus we are generating, we invested close to INR2,000 crore only last year on the new packaging board this, and also the acquisition of Corrugation business. So we have utilized so much of the funds from the company. Now, we want go again build the treasury, build the war chest and in fact I had given the target that we should have close to INR1,500 crore of the war chest before we do anything. So that is the plan.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Tushar Verma — — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Thank you so much for the answers. That’s all from me.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Thank you, Mr. Verma. Next we have Sandesh. Sandesh, please go ahead.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Sandesh — — Analyst,"Hello, sir. Hello everyone, congratulations on good set of numbers, first of all, for the full year actually. And this is the fruits of seeds, which was won actually five years back. So now going ahead just wanted to understand, sir, what would be our roadmap for next five years? Is that — what kind of capacity are we trying to achieve by FY ’24. Is it going to be bit like crore broad-based capacity expansion across our existing portfolio. We are — are we keen to grow paper board segment as it is a more structural growth story? Or is it like any other more product category we like to penetrate like craft paper or back integrate our corrugated packaging operations. Are we looking for any kind of inorganic opportunities at the moment as well?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Okay. Good. Thank you very much for complementing the team for the result. In fact, I would say that one more contributing factor was a very favorable market. And you don’t get favorable market all the time. So that’s one part. But we do — our role, we play our role in much, much better manner and that we will continue to do.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"As far as the roadmap, your question is concerned. I would say that ’23, ’24, our effort would be to utilize our Packaging Board new capacity and also the Sirpur to the 100%. So that we get the incremental the top means — the volume topline and also the advantage of profitability from higher capacity utilization. That’s one part.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Corrugation business, we are still learning. But certainly we will do better on the higher volume, utilization and new customer acquisition. So that also add value for JK Paper. Thereafter, I mean, it’s very difficult at this stage, because we are evaluating all the options for capital allocation. As I said that once we build our war chest, thereafter the capital allocation it will depend, whether the craft paper gives me advantage or whether the new acquisition gives me advantage. I mean that will all depend on the year ’23-’24, how it pens down and how the market behave. Then we take a call.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Sandesh — — Analyst,"So if I just have to look at the history of JK Paper, sir. Sir, at a lower capacity like we have been able to do large capex. And at the current capacity, we have the ability to even larger capex. So sir, even if you try to build a war chest, you can still very much afford to go for a capex even now. So what are your thoughts on that, sir?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"You are absolutely right. But see I can only tell you that 15 years back we took a risk and a chance. And you’re right that, that time our balance sheet size was small and we took a major capex. But all the time you don’t take such kind of a risk and you would recall that on a smaller balance sheet we took a call and expanded and spent INR2,000 crore and just after that for two years, we were in the rent. We incurred loss — heavy losses in the year ’13-’14 and ’14-’15 and that we don’t want to repeat. And we don’t want to disappoint our investor and all the stakeholders. Now whatever call we take, it has to be a very judicious call, very balanced call. And so that we do which is sustainable with the strong fundamentals and the financial fundamentals.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Sandesh — — Analyst,"Okay. Very much appreciate that sir. Sir, a question more on technical side, sir. So if we have to have a rough conversion of cost of pulp into paper in U.S., USD per ton basis, sir, assuming our hard BHKP prices settles around $500 per ton. So what should be import parity prices of paper and writing in India, if we were to assume the forex rate at INR83 per USD, and if you also include current logistic, and existing duty structure, sir?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See as I said that, if the pulp prices remain at $500, then the prices at the level should be somewhere around $800 to $850. And plus some kind of a $50 clearing, forwarding, other logistics or whatever it is. So, $900 price, so you calculate INR82 — $900, INR82 something downward INR74. So INR74, INR75 is a decent price, if the pulp prices are $500. But please understand on a long-term basis pulp price of $500 is not a sustainable remunerative price for the pulp manufacturers. It will be close to $550 to $600. And if $600 is the price, the pulp price $600, the paper and board prices would be close to $950 to — $900, $950, which means INR80.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Sandesh — — Analyst,"Okay, great sir. On a broader sense, sir, we’re expecting — so what is the — what will be the status of new education policy, sir? When do we expect it to get implemented? And also for industry side, can you quantify what kind of incremental demand it is expected to bring? And you know, and how long do we expect the NEP’s growth to be there in the market?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See the new education policy as far as the part is concerned, part is being implemented from the year ’23-’24. And so the publication — some publication and printing has already started. And I mean, in fact, it started sometime in November, December ’22 and this should be over — I mean it is already over now, because the new session has already been started now and the school and those will open from July some part of the country, and some part maybe from 15th of June. So part has already started. But the full implementation, our understanding that it will happen, the next education session. So that means the year ’23-’24 again will have a good demand of the writing, printing paper. But it is very difficult to quantify because — very difficult. I would only say that to what extent it is for the school, to what extent it is for colleges, to what extent it is for the professional book printing or commercial book printing, I would say that there will be a sizable demand, because of the new education policy, yes.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Sandesh — — Analyst,"Okay. So just one request from our side, sir. Sir, if you can at least publish investor presentation every quarter. So we can have access to quarterly operational data that will be absolutely great, sir.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,All right. Thank you.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Sandesh — — Analyst,"Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Thank you, Sandesh. Next we have Mr. S.B. Bhaiya. Sir, please go ahead. Mr. Bhaiya? Sir, there is no response, we’ll move on.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
SB Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Yes, yes, are you hearing me now?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Yes, yes, please go ahead.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
SB Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Sir, I’ve been associated with your company for last more than 15 years and I’ve seen your journey from say before 2010. So all your expansions actually right from your paper expansion and then paper board expansion, you have done wonderfully well. All your expansions, you have done very, very well.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Thank you so much.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
SB Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Yes, please.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Yes, yes, I said thank you so much.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
SB Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Right. So you have been doing many market leading performance and every where actually there is absolutely nothing to talk about. Of late actually, I’m seeing a distinct shift in your strategy. So from being a paper player, suddenly you started investing in a major way paper board before that, you invested in Bangalore plant. I think it was something IT related. So what is the — actually way you’re going forward, are your — that is shifting from paper to paper related items, or related — so are you shifting the company from paper company to paper-related companies? I just wanted to hear your opinion about it?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Okay. Thank you so much. See in fact, our core strength is — core strength is manufacturing. And also our core strength is volume manufacturing. And also over a period of time, we developed our core strength as a marketing also a core strength. So, these core strengths, I mean, I would say that complement and supplement for a volume production, as well as the true marketing. So I would say that we will continue to be a very strong player in the paper industry. There’s no doubt about it. So whether it is packaging paper, or it is writing, printing papers, we are going to remain as a very strong paper plant. What we thought…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
SB Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Sir, though I take it that you did not find sufficient opportunity in the paper sector actually before looking for this corrugated boxes. I’m told that right other than what you are doing that is you are already in writing and printing, you are already in paper board, which is — which are major segments. But there are other segments also, which you are doing very well and you are not presenting those. So what made you actually diversify from paper to paper board — sorry, corrugated boxes? So actually there are reasonable opportunities I thought in paper sector itself, right. Tissue paper is very, very fast growing, which you are absolutely not present. And I’m told Century and even Orient Paper is doing very, very well there.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
SB Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"So anyhow what are actually — this is actually your diversification right now is totally unrelated, you do not have any experience in there. So being an investor actually we have got question marks that how will — you will — doing it that. But if you actually expand in your paper business, at least we have got reasonable degree of story that you will be doing very well in whatever you’re doing in paper sector. So what made you go out of the paper and invest this early [Phonetic] in corrugated boxes, which I am told that, right, these are all concentrated by small scale people and low margin items and you have to near to the customer also because of the transportation cost. So you cannot expand operations in one particular place. So is there a — as an investor, we are seeing a distinct shift in this strategy and I don’t know what has made you to think so?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"No, no. I mean, your question is very, very right. But at the same time, our thought and our responses also weigh very precise and specific. I can tell you that, yes, as I said that we will remain a very strong paper player. There’s no doubt about it. See the paper writing and printing paper, we are fairly strong and we have been strong and after Sirpur acquisition because that added close to 1,30,000 ton of writing, printing paper. So that’s one addition in the paper. Then we added 1,70,000 ton of white packaging, virgin packaging board machine only last year. So again, expanded in paper. So, please understand, so now the white paper we are close to 8,00,000 ton capacity, which is India’s, I mean, the almost largest paper and packaging board capacity we have today. And we are going to do the debottlenecking in all the other stuff what we can do.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"At the same time, please understand globally also all the paper player, I mean, I’m telling you that the corrugation business is a very, very growth-oriented business in time to come. And those who enter first, they will have the prime mover advantage of consolidation opportunities. See in India, it is fragmented, but let me tell you that in U.S., the top five player of corrugation industry, they command 80% market share. In India, there will be thousands of players, but the size of the player, I mean just two acquisition, we became India’s number one corrugator. But still, number one corrugator has just 4% market share in the corrugation industry.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"So this is so much fragmented. But it will provide the huge opportunity in time to come for a consolidation, quality product. I mean, in fact in India, there are 10,000 corrugators in the country, but automatic machines are there only with 200 people. Imagine, now in time to come, when you have a quality requirement, there will be a huge opportunity for the corrugation player in time to come. This is one part.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"But also we thought that there is a huge synergy for JK Paper in corrugation business because the white virgin board what we produce goes to all the FMCG player, all the food player, all the pharmaceutical player and the same player are also buying the brown boxes. So I have a set of customer, who are getting my carton board or my white board as a packaging material and they are going for a brown material to somebody else. So I mean we thought that, why don’t we become a total packaging materials as a supplier to those customer, because we know those customers. We have the connect with the customer. This is one reason.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"The tissue, you asked this question. In fact we debated for many years, and in fact I have been debating this for 10 years internally and we don’t find, this is a remunerative product line in the paper industry. Century, Orient, they are producing, but I don’t think they are making decent money in those, in that product line. I mean, reasonable money they must be making, but it’s not very rewarding paper category. Hope I answered all of your questions.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
SB Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"No. Going forward, can I…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Mr. Bhaiya, can you please — Mr. Bhaiya, can you please come in the queue. There are couple of participants, please.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
SB Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Sure. Next we have Mr. Neeraj Mansingka. Sir, please go ahead.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Yes, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. Wanted to — few things, what has been the inflation in the wood prices in last one year or two years in a percentage terms. Just wanted to know that?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Something around 7% to 12%, depending on the — which market you’re buying.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Okay, which is in fact like an inflation only right, it’s not as if it we can…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"No, I think, more than the inflation, the inflation I would consider something around 5%, 5 and odd percent [Phonetic], but the wood price and depending on the different location from where are you buying, it was 7% to 12%.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,And do you see further inflation to continue or the pressure has moderated?,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"No, no, I’m saying that there will be further pressure.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Okay, got it. Sir, in terms of the NSR, I know you don’t share the prices, but can you give a broad range of how much the NSR has changed in percentage in last one quarter? I just want a range of — that’s okay. And industry would also be — industry market prices would also be okay, rather than only your prices. On an average…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,As I said that the coated paper prices came down by close to 15% or 20%.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Yes, 20%.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Packaging board also dropped by something around 10% to 12%.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
SB Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,And the writing printing?,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Writing printing, they were not wrong, they were no wrong.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,Okay. Okay. So do you see this because of the demand in the printers of because of the NEP or this is — what might be the reason of less demands fall in the…,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"No, it was NEP. Predominantly NEP and also now there is again a trend of the physical copies rather than just online reading. The people are interested again reading a physical book, the people are now — the school, colleges and coaching center, they are again back to the physical rather than just a virtual. So that helps.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Got it, sir. Sir, and the other question is on the international prices versus Indian prices. What we have observed is that India’s paper prices, the premium versus the international prices has increased in the last two quarters. Can you comment on that? What is the reason? And do you see this moderation coming on or are you see that to stay for some time?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"No, no. Which Paper are you comparing international and domestic?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,Uncoated Paper.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Uncoated?,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Yes, writing printing, yes.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"So uncoated paper prices globally also they were very high. In fact that six months back even maybe eight months, nine months back, the global prices were much higher than the domestic prices even. In fact, our export realization was higher than the domestic realization. But we were…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Can you give a color — can you give a color on the premium or discount of India versus international, that would be useful?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"No, no. Right now the international prices are lower. It may be lower by 7% to 10%. At one point of time, it was higher by 8%, 9%. But right now, it is lower and it will get corrected in due course of time.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"And last five years, six years, what would be that average, India was at premium or at a discount?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,I would say that the global prices were lower by 3% to 5% long-term average.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,Okay. The global was lower — global prices right.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Yes, global…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,India always commanded a premium to international prices generally.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Yes, yes. But as I said that, all the time, it will depend upon demand and supply trend of that particular period.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Okay, got it. That’s…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Immediately if a new capacity comes in the market, there will be a drop in prices.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Sir, two small questions again. On instead of giving a dividend, why don’t you do a buyback or so that it will not only improve the valuations plus also be efficient on the taxation side?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See, there are pros and cons of both and there are set of investors who would say that we are happy with the dividend. And there are investor who would say that we are happy with the buyback.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"So, investor would be happy, would be not only mostly in our mutual fund, which would be having taxation benefit, but all individual investors would be wanting a buyback, right?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,I don’t know.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,Promoter also incentive as a — promoter also have an incentive to pay taxation.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts","That all depend at which investor want to tender or want to do it. So if they want to continue to hold, some investors still want to continue the dividend. So it depends that how the investor is keeping their stock in the portfolio. So investor to investor it differs, so as a regarding hedging policy that board…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Sorry, sir, just a suggestion because, it takes care of two things rather than one thing, yes.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,All right. The suggestion is noted.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Yes, sir. And last thing is on the corrugated plant. Can you tell what is the capacity? And I think you had to also there was an acquisition cost of INR578 what I read in the annual, how much do you need to pay more? And how much is the potential to add capacity? Can you just share something on that?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"I think the capacity of the plant we acquired is what 2,60,000 tons.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"2,60,000 tons.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Yes, 2,60,000 ton. And in this industry utilization, the best utilization is considered 70% plus, because in the peak time you utilize 100% and the off time you are at 40%, 50%. So average utilization 70% plus is considered very good utilization.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Have you paid in the entire sum, or is there something to be paid left?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"As I said, then we have declared that we have paid 85%.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"We have bought 85%, 15% is still left [Indecipherable].",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,And how much is the potential to add capacity in those two locations?,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See, there will be, as I said, that these two locations, in one location we are adding capacity. By end of this year itself, there will be some addition. And the other location we don’t have to add. In fact, we need to acquire customer and utilize the capacity better.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Okay. So, I can relate it. The location that you are adding capacity will take your 260,000 tons total to how much?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"I think it is something around 20,000",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"Around 20,000 additional.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"So, 280,000.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,280 ktpa. And when you’re saying you need to acquire customer second location. So then the utilization on the current state would be lower?,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Yes, currently it is lower. So if we utilize, if we acquire customer, we can utilize it better.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,And how much is average utilization for this [Speech Overlap].,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Right now it is about 60%.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,60%.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Right now, it is 60%, so we want to take it to 70% plus.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Got it. So, but that’s — that is hardly any left. So do you also plan further expansion or do you see — because this is a very large industry.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"It is a huge capacity left out, because 10% to 15% additional utilization, means it is something around 30,000 tons to 45,000 tons, which is sizable.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,Okay. And what is the average utilization in industry for this corrugated paper?,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"I think it would be close to 60%, 65% average, but the best player would be doing 70%, 75%.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"No, no. I’m talking about average NSR for this on industry, a range.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"The NSR you asked. NSR, I have no idea. I have no idea. Because as I said that we’re still learning this trade.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
KR Veerappan — Chief Financial Officer,"And NSR is not a relevant thing because the craft paper prices all, it’s passed on that, so that based on the craft paper price fluctuation, NSR also will fluctuate. So that may not be a right [Indecipherable].",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Niraj Mansingka — White Pine Investment Management — Analyst,"Got it, got it. Thank you. Thank you from my side.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Thank you.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Sir, should we take last participant Rajesh. He is in the queue from a long time.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Okay, fortunately.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Yes, Rajesh, please go ahead.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"Yes. Hello, sir. How are you?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Good, thank you.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"I had just a couple of questions. When you look at the Q4 volumes, just 191kt, is it reasonable to assume that because of the prices, price reduction. We are not producing up to full capacity now in at least coated paper, and even the uncoated paper volumes are lower Y-o-Y basis. So Y-o-Y, in fact, the volumes are slightly lower. And second related question is that for the coming year will we then see a lower utilization as it like we were talking about 800kt in all. I’m talking about standalone business. Will we again see 750kt, 770kt given the price correction?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"What is that. There is no volume drop as far as we are concerned. Coming year also the volume is going to be higher, it can’t be lower.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts","Rajesh ji, you have seen the presentation uploaded, you know, that…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"Thank you. Sir, Q4 — okay, Q4 compared to Q4 is just 191kt, it’s the same.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts","Yes. The 191kt, 191kt it is same. The bridge that we have given, there is a slight drop compared to last previous quarter in uncoated. But if you see that overall 12 months period on the uncoated segment it is — again it’s 389kt, it’s 436kt, it’s a 12% growth.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,So should we take this year’s volume is also similar 770kt or something like that?,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,It should do better than this.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"Okay. Even after the price correction, you are saying the volume will be better.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Yes.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"And secondly, sir, my question is, do we have an option of using more imported pulp now that the pulp prices are lower instead of buying more wood in the market, in which case can we get our RM cost more?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Always we keep some kind of a ready reckoner on the table that at what price, it makes sense for me to use imported pulp and at what price it makes sense for me to produce the local pulp. So it sell max case [Phonetic] for producing the pulp out of wood here.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"Okay. That’s fair. And my last question is that we have seen the impact of pulp prices has not yet been felt in writing and printing. But will we see that impact in the coming quarter or the next two quarters because you indicated a price of — sustainable price of INR80, but if you look at it, I’m not asking you the exact realization, but it will still be somewhere around INR84, INR85 right now. So there is still scope for a downside to about INR75 after which it will come back up again. Is that the way the trend is likely to play out, what do you think, your opinion on that?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"As I said that the pulp prices globally on a long run, it should be close to $600, long run. So if it is $600 the global and the prices in the band of $900 to $950. And when it is $950 that means the NSR should be close to $950, it should be close to INR80.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"INR80, yes, but it’s still higher than INR80 as of, I mean, my assumption…",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"I mean, see, it is higher than INR80, it maybe INR2, INR3 plus or minus depending on the category and the demanding on other thing, but this should be and there would be a play of demand-supply. If there is a good demand, the prices will remain at a higher level. If the demand is lower, let’s say after the year ’23-’24 when the new education policy implementation as already happened and there is a plateau of demand, the price will come down also.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"Okay, right. So if I am permitted to ask one last question, what is the sustainable margin that you can see in this industry because we have seen like in rupees per kg margins go from INR10 to INR30 is a very large range over the last few years. What is the sustainable rupees per kg margin at an EBITDA level that you can build in on a longer-term?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See, as I said that we don’t calculate in rupee per kg, we calculate as a percentage of net sales. And I would say that anywhere between 20% to 25% is sustainable decent margin for the industry where your ROCE would be healthy.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"So, 20%, you can say, it will not break down below 20% significantly if at all?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"It’s should not. But there has been a time, where it was lower than ’21.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"Yes, exactly, yes.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"Yes, yes.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"And sir, we had also seen in the IPMA data, I mean post-COVID, there are lot of small scale guys that had actually gone out of business and the export import ratio of India was for two years, ’20-’21, ’21-’22 had turned against — in favor of exports, but if we look at ’22-’23 imports have surged again. Is that a cause for worry?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"See the imports are — because there was a higher demand in the domestic market. So, I mean, the export came down and the import was higher as far as the coated paper is concerned, the import grew, and also the other paper category, but it is not very sizable. I would say that still India will remain as a — I would say that net exporting country in time to come.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"Thank you, sir.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"But it will all depend on the craft paper export to China. If the export to China of craft paper comes down, then this is — there will be again at distortion.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Rajesh Majumdar — B&K Securities — Analyst,"Great, sir. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Yes.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,Thank you.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts","Thank you, Archana ji.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,Should we conclude the call?,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
"Ashok Gupta — Senior Vice President, Finance & Accounts",Yes.,JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Any final comments, sir, Mehta, sir any final words?",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
A.S. Mehta — President & Director,"No. Thank you very much. And as I said that the year has been a good year. But the year ’23-’24 is likely to be volatile and we need to be prepared for that volatility but at the same time because the JK Paper has its own strength, so we should do better.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd 
Archana Gude — Analyst,"Thank you so much, sir. And all the best.",JKPAPER,JK Paper Ltd

Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,Questions and Answers:,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Operator,"[Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from the line of Mr. Divya Daga from Vijit Global Securities, please go ahead.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Divya Daga — Vijit Global Securities — Analyst,Congratulations on such a great number. And my first mission is what is the expected revenue from the 3i Infotech deal this year and in the next few years? Are you in talks for the deals and what is the revenue recognition model for that?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Okay, so this deal with the 3i Infotech is regarding WIFI monetizing as I have told already that we have provided them a canvas of — canvas space for advertisers. So that the advertisers get their advertisements to them so there is a minimum guarantee of INR14 crore per annum and over and above. If they have revenue, they have to share 40% of their revenue with us with the minimum guarantee of INR14 crores. So whichever is higher, they will share. So this year, maybe another three months, they will be launching their services, this monetizing part, but their the payment period has already started. The minimum guarantee they have to start paying now. I believe your answer is — you are satisfied with the answer?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Divya Daga — Vijit Global Securities — Analyst,Basically I was asking that what is the expected revenue we are expecting in this financial year from 3i?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"I told you, this is — any WiFi system globally has not been a profitable business. This is the first time it is happening because we have a very large ecosystem of WiFi, where 17,000 ATs are installed all over the country. And the space will be open to so many footfalls. So this is the first time we will be doing it, and we are expecting good results. But still it depends upon the execution. So we are working onto it. And another treatment, we will see the results. It has been finalized to tender, open tender. I would not like to comment any number now, but yeah, minimum guarantee is there. So this year, at least we may not be expecting anything big. Depending upon the success of this experiment, maybe next year onwards, we can say something about it.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Divya Daga — Vijit Global Securities — Analyst,"Or when the revenue will start coming, how will we recognize that? It will come in other income or in the top line?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"It is other income. It is operating income, no sorry. It is operating income, but not telecom or projects.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Divya Daga — Vijit Global Securities — Analyst,"Okay. My second question is, in Q2 FY23 con call, you said that you are expecting around INR50 crores from data centers, am I right?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,Yeah.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Divya Daga — Vijit Global Securities — Analyst,Are we on it or is there any change?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"From data center is income you all are asking — so we will be certainly increasing the services and numbers will be more. This year, we have done INR52 crores and at present here, we are expecting somewhere around INR100 crores.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Divya Daga — Vijit Global Securities — Analyst,Okay. Can you just give me what services you’re providing and how is the model and everything about data center basically?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"So data center, basically they are different types of services like a pure colocation services which now we are not very much keen to expand upon. Then we are providing core computing facilities to the — so that basically we host the applications and our machines, that is the virtual machines, you can call it. And then, there are security-as-a-service, then application-as-a-service also like we are providing e-office, hospital management information system, the application-as-a-service is also there.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Divya Daga — Vijit Global Securities — Analyst,So as you said that it is on asset light model. So what is that exactly?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Asset-light model means — that is I would say, basically we have not put in money into — basically the money which we have put in this data center activity is not very high because these are applications. The customer does can command and start using our services. Whenever demand comes, yeah, we can immediately start getting the services like Aadhaar authentication service. It is the service being provided at our data center. So we are already having our system platform available with us and customers start using that immediately, there’s no time taken in providing this service.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Divya Daga — Vijit Global Securities — Analyst,Is it like an annual subscription?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"No, it is not annual subscription. It’s based on usage. Aadhaar-based authentication services are usage base. Suppose this year, we have conducted complete JEE exam, it was conducted through our Aadhaar authentication biometric services. And so whenever the exam is conducted, they are using it and paying it for physically per user.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Divya Daga — Vijit Global Securities — Analyst,Okay. So what is the revenue recognition model for data centers?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"So there are different models. Actually, like this one is for instant based Aadhaar authentication per instances, but there are continuously application posters. So that’ll be annual of income coming to us. Then there’ll be applications which are provided by us, that is also depending upon the license based or how many concurrent users are there, those kind of assumptions are there, so there are really various models. And these models are continuously evolving. There is no single model of revenues earning.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Divya Daga — Vijit Global Securities — Analyst,So is this year…,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Operator,"Sorry to interrupt you Ms. Divya, may we request you to return to the question queue ma’am. We have follow up question from several other participants.

Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,A lot of noise coming from your end.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vignesh Iyer — Sequent Investments — Analyst,Am I audible now?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD

Vignesh Iyer — Sequent Investments — Analyst,"No, I’m using my handset mode now.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Operator,Yes. Please go ahead.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vignesh Iyer — Sequent Investments — Analyst,"Yeah. So I remember in the quarter 2 call, you’ve guided that for the project how you operate quarter 1 and quarter 2, could we slower. So just to understand, keeping that in mind, I mean would we see some progress YoY, when it comes to project business in quarter 1 quarter 2 or it would be more or less flattish?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Yeah. I have been saying this again and again because we are a small company. And quarter for a company of our size is a small period. So there may be quarter-on-quarter, they may not be two indications I would say. But still, we are having good order book with us. So we expect that good numbers will come in quarter 1, quarter 2 also.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vignesh Iyer — Sequent Investments — Analyst,Okay. And could you tell me what is the size of the order book as on 31st March 2023? And what would be the expected time of execution for the same?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD

Operator,"[Operator Instructions] We take the next question from the line of Pratap Maliwal from Mount Intra Finance Private Limited, please go ahead.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Pratap Maliwal — Mount Intra Finance Private Limited — Analyst,We’ve had a good increase in our project revenue this quarter. So I just wanted to ask how much of this was from the VSS order that we were supposed to collect in Q4?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"VSS, it’s around INR85 crores.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Pratap Maliwal — Mount Intra Finance Private Limited — Analyst,"Okay. So our total collections of was supposed to be I think in the range of INR400 crores. So are they going to be flowing into the next year as well, the VSS?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Yes. This year, we will be distributing major chunk of VSS.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Pratap Maliwal — Mount Intra Finance Private Limited — Analyst,"Okay. So out of the INR400 crore order, how much are we done till now?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Till now, maybe around INR150 crores including the previous one also.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Pratap Maliwal — Mount Intra Finance Private Limited — Analyst,"INR150 crores done. And I just wanted some idea on the VSS order, so we are doing the project for the railway stations. Is it a separate order for VSS in coaches for next year that we may get, is that a separate order?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"No, that is a separate order, but that order we are not counting now because there is rethink going on in with the Ministry of Railways as how to execute this surveillance system in coaches, because there are some — see, coach is a body wherein there are many devices already fitted. So we are working on netiquettes of that. So that you might have seen in the news also maybe on the portal also that we have right now capped this tender on hold. Right now, we are not counting that order in our order kit.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Pratap Maliwal — Mount Intra Finance Private Limited — Analyst,"Understood, thank you. And just wanted to understand that going forward, can we get some kind of idea as to what maybe margin level that an EBIT level, we intend to keep either on an overall basis of our project basis, any color on that?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"So if you talk of project, we would try to keep the range of 6% to 7%.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Pratap Maliwal — Mount Intra Finance Private Limited — Analyst,Okay. And how will we maybe — because I think currently we are at slightly lower level for Q4. So what would drive that increase?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"See there are multiple factors. Number one is the selection of projects where we are going. So these LLE select projects where there is an element of telecom, there is an element of data center and then there is an element of IT applications and all that. So generally, we prefer projects where these 2 elements are also present. And then that these 2 elements help us with keeping our margins higher.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Pratap Maliwal — Mount Intra Finance Private Limited — Analyst,"And telecom revenues — I’m sorry, telecom margins would be in the range of the usual 19% to 20%, is that it?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Yes. See our telecom margins, EBIT margins already 33% for the last financial year.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Operator,"Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Shubham Shukla from Voyager Capital, please go ahead.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"So my first question is around the margin. So on telecom sector, like if you could give breakup of margin from project work and telecom work?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"For quarter or for the year, you are asking for?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,Both actually.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"So if you talk of EBITDA margin for telecom services for the quarter gone by, it was 29%. And for project work, it was 4%.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,And yearly?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"And yearly, it was 33% for telecom and 5% for the projects.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"Okay. And the second would be on the order book. We currently have INR4,500 crores on the order book and we as far as I can remember, we had the similar range of order book in quarter 2. So like we didn’t see any growth there?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"So see, there was like last 4 to 5 months, we have received new orders of around INR1,000 crores. There has been implementation that’s why you have seen that Q4 result there was and some growth in project income also. And there orders have been coming and implementing and then new orders are getting added. So that is our continuous process.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"So this current order book, does it provide any visibility for revenues like if you could say, like a year or two revenue visibility?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"This year, I see project income of around INR1,500 crore.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD

Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Next year, from this order book you are asking or we’ll be having new orders for…",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"No, for FY24 like any type of…",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"For FY24, so somewhere around INR2,500 crores. We will be — to get…",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"INR2,500 crores of…",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"INR2,000 to INR2,500.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,Revenue we will be adding.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Should be. We’d be working towards that. ’24, ’25. I’m talking of ’24, ’25.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"INR2,400 crores to INR2,500 crores, right?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"No. I’m talking of financial year ’24, ’25. ’23, ’24 is INR1,500 crores.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"Okay. For financial year ’24 like ’23, ’24, it’s INR1,500 crores. For ’24 to ’25, it should be somewhere around, what?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD

Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"For project income, okay. Thank you so much and good luck.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,Thank you.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Operator,"Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Mr. Amit Kumar from Determined Investments, please go ahead.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Amit Kumar — Determined Investments — Analyst,"Just quick question on this WiFi monetization. You mentioned INR14 crores minimum guarantee amount. I was just wondering the WIFI that you maintain across stations of Indian Railways, what would be the — for the operating expense on an annual basis of sort of managing the infrastructure broadly?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"It would be — if you talk of maintaining, it will be around INR10 crores to INR12 crores.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Amit Kumar — Determined Investments — Analyst,Marginal profitability?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Yeah. So no, actually we are pooling resources. There are people who are working as our network along the railway track which is 61,000 kilometers. So they are resources and the same resources are pool projects. So we actually do not dedicatedly provide any man power for that. That is a small internet bandwidth expenditure which is continuously coming down as an as a cost to us because of international and national scenario in this market.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Amit Kumar — Determined Investments — Analyst,"Okay, got it. And just one question on your RDN and content on delivery COD, planned previously. Any sort of update on these contracts also? When can we expect any sort of action on these fronts?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"I think during last interaction also I mentioned that RDN is also RDN and COD, both are being given a fresh thought in the Ministry of Railways. And that is why we have not included these two projects in our order book also. Now we are awaiting further instructions from Ministry. So they are not there on our radars right now.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Amit Kumar — Determined Investments — Analyst,"All right, that’s it from my side. Thank you.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Dhvani Shah from Investec, please go ahead.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Dhvani Shah — Investec — Analyst,Am I audible?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Yeah, could you be slightly louder?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Dhvani Shah — Investec — Analyst,"Yeah. So first of all just nearer the break up on NND, ISP and IP within the telecom, if you can give it on an annual basis?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Just a minute. So for the financial year gone by, we have total IP1 income of INR215 crores, ISP income of INR380 crores out of which RailWire is INR318 crores and NND INR559 crores.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Dhvani Shah — Investec — Analyst,"Okay. Also I just want to understand, so the project is for good ramp up and of that, the VSS with almost INR85 crores. So VSS was supposed to come in at higher margins of almost 8%. So have not started executing your change in strategy you’ve mentioned last quarter saying that the coming forward projects will be at a lower margin given that your focus will be more on volume and is that also why you’ve called out want to be in INR100 crores over the next year and that we’d say that essentially the run rate actually we saw in Q4 will continue going forward?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,Could you summarize your question?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Dhvani Shah — Investec — Analyst,Yes. I’m asking that the margins that you saw in project business were at 2.3% this time and VSS project was mentioned would be almost 8%. That was almost INR85-odd crores of incremental revenues that stand at the project business. So are the other projects at a lower margin?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"No, actually I would say that it’s 4%, 4-point-something percent. No, last quarter. So there was some project capacity we’ve got with lower margin and that of course affected us in that. But now we will be slightly cautious because there are many projects, there is no dearth of projects business, and we will be slightly selective in bidding for projects where margins are certainly better so that we continue to remain in 6% to 7% bracket.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Dhvani Shah — Investec — Analyst,"Okay. And I just one other clarification on the other expenses part. Overall basis you’ve come down from INR30 crores to INR10 crore, can you explain the difference please? Was there a one-off to expenses?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Hello, your voice is slightly breaking.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Dhvani Shah — Investec — Analyst,"Just wanted to understand the other expenses for the quarter, they have come down to INR100 million, INR103 million from INR300 million last quarter. Can you just explain that difference? Were there any one offs?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Our ED Finance, Mr. Batra will answer this. In the meantime, if you have any other questions, then you can ask that, otherwise then…",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Dhvani Shah — Investec — Analyst,"No, that’s it. Thank you.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Yeah, over to Mr. Batra.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
"H C Batra — ED, Finance & Chief Investor Relation Officer","It’s primarily because of the PTL. In the last quarter PTL probably [Indecipherable], which is not there in the March quarter.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Dhvani Shah — Investec — Analyst,"Okay, thanks.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Operator,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We take the next question from the line of Nitin Gandhi from KIFS Trade Capital, please go ahead.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Nitin Gandhi — KIFS Trade Capital — Analyst,"So increasing network by almost 10 times and you have certain projects. So can you share how is the project average execution time out of your order book of INR4,500 crores? And how you are spending of because 3 or 4 times of network capacity utilization in next 1 or 2 years?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"See I believe are both separate question. So projects yeah. Is it’s not directly related to any network capacity prices somewhere it may be utilized. All right. But if you talk of project business so out of this 4500 crores, we are expecting that around 1500 crore income, we will be booking this current financial year.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Nitin Gandhi — KIFS Trade Capital — Analyst,"That I got it. You said that for two years, [Indecipherable] we have expected,",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,Yes.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Nitin Gandhi — KIFS Trade Capital — Analyst,But I’m speaking average duration.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"So there are projects which are going up to eight years also, one year the implementation or 1.5 years for implementation. And then and then one year or two years for warranty and then another five years for maintenance A&P also. There are projects with 3 years and then after three years, they are getting renewed also and IVRs also there are projects. But implementation is generally 1, 1.5 years.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Nitin Gandhi — KIFS Trade Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Out of 4,500, how much is O&M?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"O&M may be out of this INR4,500 crore, O&M would be INR500 crore also.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Nitin Gandhi — KIFS Trade Capital — Analyst,Fine. And now network related.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"We are not really worked out on this, but I guess. Because those are smaller amounts, generally 3% to 4% kind of a number per annum kind of.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Nitin Gandhi — KIFS Trade Capital — Analyst,"Right. And now regarding network, wish you can share something.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,Majority are basically one to two years. Majority of the numbers are getting converted into revenue in initial years and remaining 15% maybe depending upon the number of years they are going. 10% to 15% or so.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Operator,"Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Mr. Vishal Periwal from IDBI Capital, please go ahead.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,"Yes, thanks for the opportunity. A couple of a data point if I can ask, what is the real via subscriber base currently with us?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,It is 5.21 lakh.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,Okay and I mean if you have this number ready for FY22 for comparison sake?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,4.63.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay. And then for maybe a full year basis project side, if you can give a breakup of revenue between railway and non railway.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,Railway for this year gone by was INR155 crores and other project was INR619 crores.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,Non railway in INR619 crores?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,619.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay. But just one clarification then, if a non railway piece is increasing for us, so any reason that the margins are subdued for us?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"No, there is. Yeah, railway of course gives us because there were projects which are given to us on nomination basis and there were healthy margin of 88.5% with us and outside projects even now in railways also we are getting orders by bid, nothing on nomination. So, then of course when we are in competition, margins are decided by the competition and not nomination. So there is an effect of competition, but then you are seeing that in other projects. This year we have only 13% to 14% income from railway including telecom income.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay and then a like-to-like basis sir, between railway and non railway sort of particular projects, will it be fair to say that now given a competition in normal side so railway gives us better margins because it’s non railway or it’s underpinned?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"I told you, even railway is not now a competition for us. We have to get any work through competition only. So I don’t see any difference but those projects like video surveillance, it is already going on. So, of course there will be better margin. We are already in the cubic.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay, and then the 1,500 crores top line unless you’re expecting for FY 24, the margin expectation is in the range of 5-odd percent, that’s what you said right, sir? Just a clarification.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Yeah, we can say, we will try to get 6% to 7%. 5% of course is assured, I can say.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay, and on a telecom I think can guide in a similar way, how exactly you’re seeing things are in the next year on the margin and the topping front because I mean maybe parallel question to that, like you mentioned, like you know, we have expanded the capacity by 10.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"There has been telecom margins were slightly dipping. You might have seen. Because of some of our fiber was getting older. And we are not yet decided, we have not decided to replace them, but we are continuing with that fiber and repairing it. So there is some maintenance expenditure going on without going in for capex. There are already over but we are continuing with the pay method. So there is some increase in the opex on optical fiber maintenance. And that is how the CRB, we see that there is slight dip in the telecom margin.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,Okay. How do we see things in next year in terms of margins?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,Maybe more or less at the same level.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,That is on a quarterly basis.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,We had EBITDA margin of 33% in comparison to last year of 35%.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay, well, maybe I’ll try to understand this in detail with you offline. And then one last question from my side and then I’ll come in the queue. The same thing network expansion that has happened that is the along the railway track the optic fiber which is there which side of the business you are saying?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Earlier our network was based on 10G system now it has 100G system. So straightaway we have multiplied by 10, so we have good amount of capacity available to them.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Vishal Periwal — IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay. Sure, thanks a lot. I’ll come back in the queue.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD

Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Yeah, so less than a year, number is already there with new business INR700 crores and remaining is more than a year. Roughly around INR400 crores.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Richa Shah — Individual Investor — Analyst,"No, so I want to know more than six months is how much?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD

Richa Shah — Individual Investor — Analyst,That would be the receivable numbers. I want to know the receivable days. The debtor days.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Days. So this is, that is 191 for the year gone by and now it’s been 192 for the year gone by. Yeah, but see, actually this 192 number which you are seeing, since the our project income has gone up, so what is happening in project income, where many projects we take with our partners and there is the receivables as well as payables also. So it actually does not affect our cash flows because we pay only when our payments are made by the customers. So these numbers are failing, because of this reason, because project income has increased substantially you have seen in our account statement also. So that is the major reason. And there are project milestones also, some project is going on for maybe one and a half years. So there are various milestones. When these payments are due, so then but they are they have to be shown as per in their calendars so that is the reason.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD

Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, hi once again. So I just if I can recall the last statement on your margin from telecom sector, so you said that we are having we are incurring some minor fiber maintenance. These are my minor maintenance then, why are EBITDA margins falling from 35% to 13%, because some minor maintenance as you see it, but the drop in margin is quite significant, does that justify?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Only 2%, 33% banking is up 13%.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"From, I didn’t get it. From?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD

Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,Yeah.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,And for ’25.,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"’25 also because the revenue in telecom business by capacity wise, it is growing, but since price are continuously under pressure in market, telecom market, so the numbers are not commensurate with the services we are providing. So again, I can get the number of 1,700 — 1,600 to 1,700 for the next year.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Shubham Shukla — Voyager Capital — Analyst,"Okay and margins on these project work would be similar to like 6%, 7% for next two years?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD

Amit Kumar — Determined Investments — Analyst,"Just one follow-up. I think you mentioned on number of INR200 crores for capex for this fiscal ’23, ’24. I just want to understand, what is — can you just break it down between maintenance and growth capex and across both of those any sort of major element that you want to sort of highlight and what’s the principal areas in which that capex is divided?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"So I’ve also mentioned in my interest also. Partly, it will go towards network upgradation further basically inhibiting the capacity, capacity when I say enhancing the capacity, it is basically adding to the existing system. We can increase the capacity up to 800 G — 8,000 G, that is the maximum capacity we can go so partly it will go through that. Partly, it will go through the data center augmentation also and then we are — we have already planned for a largest scale automation in about the POS system to increase our institutions and productivity. So these are the major key segments we will be spending this money.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Amit Kumar — Determined Investments — Analyst,Will there be constant decrease to put some numbers to in each one of these? And what would be the maintenance capex also I just wanted to get some thoughts on that?,RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Sanjai Kumar — Chairman & Managing Director,"Maintenance, it does not come in — Maintenance is never part of capex. That is part of revenue expenditure.",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD 
Amit Kumar — Determined Investments — Analyst,"Okay. In terms of the different pieces, how does this INR200 crores of productive?",RAILTEL,RAILTEL CORP OF INDIA LTD

Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to the NGL Fine-Chem Limited Q4 FY’23 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,I now hand the conference over to Mr. Abhishek Mehra from TIL Advisors. Thank you and over to you.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Abhishek Mehra — TIL Advisors — Analyst,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining this Q4 FY’23 earnings conference call of NGL Fine-Chem Limited.

Abhishek Mehra — TIL Advisors — Analyst,"To take us through the results of this quarter and answer your questions, we have with us today Mr. Rahul Nachane, Managing Director, and Mr. Rajesh Lawande, Whole-Time Director and Chief Financial Officer. We’ll be starting the call with a brief overview of the financial performance, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. I wanted to remind you all that everything said on this call reflecting any outlook for the future which can be construed as a forward-looking statement must be view it in conjunction with uncertainties and risks that the company faces. These uncertainties and risks are included but not limited to what we mentioned in our annual reports, which you’ll find on the company website.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Abhishek Mehra — TIL Advisors — Analyst,"And that said, I’ll now hand over the call to Mr. Rahul. Over to you, sir.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Thank you, Abhishek. Good morning and thank you for joining the call today. I’m delighted to provide you with an update on the performance of NGL Fine-Chem Limited for the fourth quarter of FY’23. I will spend a few minutes to share the highlights of our performance and address the challenges we have faced in recent months, before we open up for questions.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"First and foremost, I am pleased to inform you that we have successfully maintained our trajectory towards the sequential recovery in our business, as we had anticipated and communicated earlier. Our operating margins for the quarter recorded a significant improvement primarily due to notable decrease in raw material prices. I’ll answer it this favorable factor, our diligent cost management practices have played a crucial role in enhancing our overall profitability. However, it is important to acknowledge that the demand for our product has remained relatively subdued.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"The prevailing high level of uncertainty among our end customers caused by the ongoing crisis in Europe, an elevated inflation rates in several countries has led to cautious behavior and measures to rationalize inventory levels. As a result, we are experiencing muted demand for our products. Furthermore, we have also been impacted by currency crisis in certain regions, notably among countries such as Turkey, Bangladesh, Egypt, and Pakistan. The adverse economic conditions in these areas as further dampen the recovery of demand for our products.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Looking ahead, we anticipate that the operating environment will continue to present challenges for the next two quarters. However, I’m proud to announce that despite these difficult circumstances, we have managed to maintain our market share. We have also introduced new product offerings and expanded our core product portfolio to 24 products in veterinary API segment and two in the human health segment. Validation batches for these new products have been completed. And we have initiated the process for obtaining customer approvals.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"In terms of capacity expansion plans, we have made the strategic decision to temporarily slow down the execution speed due to the availability of spare capacity at our existing site. This approach ensures optimal resource allocation and cost management. As the operating environment improves and visibility is restored, we will expedite the execution phase accordingly.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Importantly, I want to emphasize that until we see demand recovery, we are averse to funding this expansion to borrowings and we will strive to fund our capital expenditure using the internal accruals generated by our business.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Now let us turn our attention to the key headline numbers for the fourth quarter of FY’23. Our revenue from operations amounted to INR73.89 crores, representing a 2.72% increase compared to the previous quarter at a 12.1% decrease year-on-year. The EBITDA stood at INR12.97 crores, reflecting a robust growth of 32.2% quarter-on-quarter and 22.7% year-on-year. Our EBITDA margins improved to 17.55%, recording an increase of 391 basis points quarter-on-quarter and 498 basis points year-on-year. Finally, our profit-after-tax is INR9.32 crore, marking a growth of 43.6% quarter-on-quarter and 35.66% year-on-year.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Before I conclude, I want to express my deepest gratitude to each and every one of you for your unwavering trust and steadfast support. Rest assured we remain fully committed to delivering long-term value to all our stakeholders. I would just like to add that, going forward we plan to hold analyst calls on a half-yearly basis.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,I am now happy to open the floor for any questions you may have.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Questions and Answers:,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rahul Jain with Credence Capital. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Jain — Credence Capital — Analyst,Thank you for the opportunity. Am I audible?,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yes, you are.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Jain — Credence Capital — Analyst,"Sure. Thank you. So first of all, congratulations, Rahul, in a tough environment. We have followed a prudent principles in terms of cost declaration and which has felt that our margin improvement as it free as promised by you two quarters back. So the first question itself is on margin, Rahul? So going forward, given the prices of products and raw material prices, do we expect the gross margins which we have reported in this quarter, March ’23 to sustain and further improve as we go forward?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Right, any other question here or just one?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Jain — Credence Capital — Analyst,"Okay. So my next question is about the capex, you have said that you are moving a bit slow. Earlier, our plan was to complete this by March ’24, so based on the current situation, when do we expect this greenfield capex to pickup? And lastly, with regards to our revenue, so typically with the prices being down and the top line, which we have done, so what kind of volume growth we have done and is the revenue growth, volumes are growing, but the prices are low, which is where the revenue growth is still some time away? Or how do we look at the revenue growth going forward, considering that we have launched four new products? That is it.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Right. Thank you, Rahul. With regard to gross margins, things are still very fluid position right now. When demand is down, there is obviously oversupply in the market. And there is intense competition amongst sellers to meet whatever little demand that exists in the market. So until that equilibrium is reached, again, there will continue to be pressure on selling prices. Now we were aided by lower raw material costs in the last quarter, which has been coming on the back of a steady decrease in most chemical prices over the last three quarters. As we speak, I think probably around May of ’23 — sorry May of ’22 and since then have been coming down gradually over the last one year. And chemical prices more or less seem to have what would have bottomed out now. The decrease in prices and lower prices that has also been pressure on selling prices for us, so for the next two quarters, there is going to be a pressure on margins and the volumes may move a little bit sideways, plus, minus 2%, 3% from where we currently are. Once we see a demand recovery, we are confident that margins will go back to the earlier levels which we have attained over a five, seven year period.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"With regard to the capex, we have deliberately slowed it down, because in a market which is where we see demand growth a little dampened now. We did not see the need to borrow and invest in new projects. So we are funding the project a little more slowly. So yes, earlier it was planned to go on-stream by March ’24. And we may see a further delay of anything from six months to a year on that. But again, it is more like a wait-and-watch thing. I would not like to put a date to on it. We are very sure that once we see demand recovery, within a period of one year, we can execute the entire project, because we fairly advanced with the civil construction. We have identified equipment started entering into discussions with the equipment supplier. So our equipments are only selected, final price negotiation and placing on equip — of orders will be done only when we see the demand recovery actually coming.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"And your last point with regard to volume growth, yes, bidding — price realization has definitely decreased for us in a number of our products. Therefore, we’re doing the same sort of volume. We need to — actually it is, again the same sort of top line we need to sell much more quantity. Luckily, we have been sort of supported by the new products which we have launched. Quite a few have been in the $100 plus rates and therefore though the volume growth has been affected, top line has still been able to — we are still being able to hold on top line. I hope this answers your question.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Jain — Credence Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, sure. And just on the product side, with regards to introducing new products. And you mentioned in your initial remarks, the validation part over or almost done. And in the previous call, you had mentioned about five new products coming in and the commercial supplies to start so. As we speak now with regards to this five new products, how many products are in the commercial supply stage and with regards to the balance. So what is the schedule of this new products commercial supplies have been started?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So we have gone out from a total basket of 22 products to about 26 products now, which are company sellers that are being sold. We have got another six products, which are being worked into the laboratory and in the private plan at various levels. So we hope to take our total product line up to 35 products for the next two years now.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Jain — Credence Capital — Analyst,"Sure. Thank you so much, Rahul. Wish you all the best. I’ll come back for further questions. Thank you.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Vishal Prasad with VP Capital. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Vishal Prasad — VP Capital — Analyst,"Hi, good morning. Sir, in the past, we have mentioned that market size for 22 products is INR1,500 crore. So is this the volume market, we are talking about rest of world market size?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Right. Can you please put all your questions, so that we can go through all of them at one go?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Vishal Prasad — VP Capital — Analyst,"Yeah. So if you could tell me the world market size for 22 products and probably not world but rest of world market size. And also if you can tell me the residential market size for top 10 products that will be helpful? Also in the past, we have talked about — you have mentioned that we are number one in six products and number two in other five. So if this holds. Is there some change that will be all?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Right. So for market size for our top 22 products, when we said, it was INR1,500 crores that is up with the world market, not just the India market. And it is world market size in terms of the APEX sales, not in terms of the finished products sales. I unfortunately don’t have the market size for the top 10 products to give you across the table right now. Yes, and with regards to our market leadership size, we continue to be number one in our top three products and number two in five. So there has been no change in that and we have been able to hold on to our market share in these products.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Vishal Prasad — VP Capital — Analyst,"So sir, this INR1,500 crore you say, this is the market size world over, but we do not supply — generally don’t supply in the developed markets. So if we remove EU and U.S. then roughly, what would be the market size for our 22 products?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So the product which we are doing close to about 70%, 75% of these products are basically tropical disease products. There is very little demand in the U.S. and Europe for those. So there will be probably about 25%, 30% of the products which we do, which have got a demand in the U.S. and Europe, I think we can probably remove another INR250 crores, INR300 crores whatever, but I am just guessing. I really don’t have that sort of a number to tell you straightaway right now.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Vishal Prasad — VP Capital — Analyst,"So even if it remove our INR500 crore out of that and we go with INR1,000 crore —",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"I did see INR500 crores, it would be in the range probably of about INR250 crores, INR300 crores. And I am guessing it this please — and please don’t quote me on this again, because it’s a very offline question. And it’s just a guess right now.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Vishal Prasad — VP Capital — Analyst,"I understand. So out of INR1,200 crores we are doing close to INR200 crores. So we have just having 15%, 18% market size in 22 product and then we said, we are number-one in three, and number two in five. So if I say for top eight products, we have close to 50% market share. The numbers I’m not matching somehow for 800 product if we see the market size is INR600 crore and we are doing INR150 crores, it’s just 25%, out of it.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,But that would also depend on the total market size of each product. So I cannot add more to that right now.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Vishal Prasad — VP Capital — Analyst,"Sure, thank you sir.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darshil Pandya with Finterest Capital. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Darshil Pandya — Finterest Capital — Analyst,"Hello sir, good morning. Am I audible?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Good morning.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Darshil Pandya — Finterest Capital — Analyst,"Good morning, sir. So, basically majority of the questions were asked. So I have two or three few more questions, I’ll ask them one way.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Can you speak louder please? You are not really coming out clearly.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Darshil Pandya — Finterest Capital — Analyst,Can you hear me now?,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yeah, this is much better.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Darshil Pandya — Finterest Capital — Analyst,"Okay, perfect. So as you said that the capacity expansion plan hasn’t slowed down. So that assumes that we have a lot of capacity in the existing plants. Can you just provide a number as to what capacity utilization we are running at currently?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Yeah. Probably we had around 75% to 80%.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Darshil Pandya — Finterest Capital — Analyst,"75% to 80%. Okay. And sir, you said that — we are — there are new products added to the total product count, so can you please provide or what is the — how much revenue that this new product can generate over the time?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So we have 22 products which we were doing earlier, the total market size was about INR1,500 crores. And we are probably add just about 15%, 18% market share for the overall. So for the four new products, we have added, I really don’t have a number to share with you right now. But these are all basically products in the range of about INR30 crores to INR60 crores sort of market size for each of the products.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Darshil Pandya — Finterest Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. And one final question, sir. Have we added any new customers during the quarter, how is it like?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Customer addition is a continuous process. So yes, we have added new customers during this quarter also.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Darshil Pandya — Finterest Capital — Analyst,Any numbers specifically?,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"I will need to check up on that. So give me some time, somewhere during this conversation, I will come back and let you know.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Darshil Pandya — Finterest Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Just one final question, sir. And many of the calls, we are hearing that China have been started up production and they are not — they are lagging and literally damping up. So we do have any views on this or is it affecting our business, something that helps us to understand more.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So as I have said see, we are right now in a situation where the demand/supply has shifted. So demand has fallen drastically, supply has remained stable, it’s not just China dumping. It is also lot of Indian companies dumping. So let us not just point fingers at one country. But it is a worldwide phenomenon where lots of suppliers are chasing very few buyers. And this will continue until the demand stabilizes and equalizes. So yes, we are facing pressure and it is not just from Chinese companies, it is also from our Indian competitors.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Darshil Pandya — Finterest Capital — Analyst,"Got it, sir. Thank you so much. And we expect that you will come up with a good numbers going forward. Thank you so much.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Ankit Gupta with Bamboo Capital. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Yeah. Sir, over the past five to — first of all, congratulations on a decent set of numbers in tough environment. So no, on the demand side, where are we in terms of inventory destocking, past five, six quarters we have seen severe inventory destocking across the geographies that we target? So in terms of inventory stocking, where are we. And when do you think that the demand, it will come back. That was my first question. The second question was on, we were under the impression that the newer products, which had been launched that will be launched from the new site that we — or the new greenfield capacity which was coming up? And now, it seems that we have also manufacturing them in existing facilities. So if you can give some thoughts on that and the next 10 set of products or the next 10 set of new product that we plan to commercialize over the next few years. So they will also be manufactured in our existing setup or not? And my third question was on the existing capacity or the existing capacity that we have. How much revenue can we generate from it now at optimal capacity utilization, given the price decline at GST? And if you can also share, we’ve also been increasing the proportion of outsourcing, which you were seeing in earlier calls that we had reduced. So if you can give us a ballpark number on how much revenue can we generate from our existing facility?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Right. Thank you for the question. With regards to the inventory destocking, we are just taking place at across the world. Different countries are at different levels right now. So but probably we are looking at the tail end of that whole exercise. It seems to have been completed in most of the — of the countries or customers we’re speaking with. And the few that we estimate will probably end up consuming their stocks either in this quarter or later by the next quarter.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"With regard to new products, which we are manufacturing, all our facilities are designed for multiproduct facilities. So it is very easy for us to move from one facility to the other and filling capacity. So the new products, which we were doing, all of them were not planned only for the — with the new facility in mind because that was still any which ways plan to come up with 2024. So whatever new products, which we are doing we are filling in existing capacity only. At the existing capacity, I have said this earlier also that we have a revenue potential in the range of about INR350 crores to INR380 crores with the capacity which we have got.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"And finally with regard to outsourcing, we are more or less brought down the total amount of the total quantity of products, which we have outsourced. And our total outsourcing over the last 18 months has decreased substantially. So today I will not count whatever we do as Macrotech as outsourcing because that’s our 100% subsidiary. So ignoring Macrotech, we are — our outsourcing is probably just said about between 1% and 3% right now. And it was our objective to take it up to 15% years ago, when demand was going down. So we have brought down outsourcing with two intensions. Number one, why keep capacity ideal in our own factories. Number two, outsourcing is relatively more expensive. So why outsource and why not cut the cost when [Indecipherable]. But as and when demand rises, this is something which can go up again. I hope that answers your question.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Sure, sir. So when the demand comes up, we can increase the outsourcing and this can also increase our revenue potential from our existing facilities?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,That is right. Yeah.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Sure. And sir, if you can broadly on a ballpark number that you can give on how much has been the realization decline in our top three or top five or ten products across the board? How much has been declining prices over the past year or so?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"It varies from product-to-product. In some products, we have been lucky that decline is not more than 5% to 6%. There are some products where we have seen a 25% decline also. So on an average I would say that, the decline in price realization is in the range of 15% to 20%.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Perfect. Thank you and wish you all the best. Thanks.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Dwanil Desai with Turtle Capital. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Dwanil Desai — Turtle Capital — Analyst,"Hi, good morning, Rahul. So my first question is, you have mentioned that we will go slow on our new capex. Now you also mentioned that we are operating it around 70%, 75% capacity utilization. So just thinking a lot, but is it possible that since the demand has been dampened and inventory destocking has happened. If suddenly demand comes back and channels are empty then, isn’t it better to have capacity in hand, considering our balance sheet is in very good shape. So how do you think about that? That would be the first question. Second question, if I look at the customer concentration I think, this year, looks like that the large customers you have been doing more business and the long tail that we have had the business has declined. So any dynamics at play there?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Dwanil Desai — Turtle Capital — Analyst,"Third question is, I think we had China is a very different market and that market was not available because of the lockdown, now China has opened up. So how the business is normalizing over there? And the last one is, so I think last year we de-grown from FY’22 base? So looking at FY’24 with thinks normalizing maybe three, six months down the line and new products. Do we expect any growth from FY’23 base? I think, we were looking at some 20% kind of a growth on FY’21 being, if I remember correctly? Yeah, these are the four questions.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yes. Thank you, Dwanil. With regarding your first question, if demand suddenly comes back then what do we do with this. So right now, as I said, we are fairly confident that as and when we see demand recovery, we can set this capacity up within a period of just one year. So what we have been doing is, we have not being sitting idle. Civil work [Indecipherable] especially is almost 90% completed the project as of now. Equipment selection and equipment identification process has been completed. What we have not done is, we have not entered into commercial discussions and place orders. So we are fairly confident that within the span of 12 months from the time we decide, we should be able to get this facility up and running.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"The flipside of having capacity setup right now is. Number one, it’s a fairly large expansion for our company. We like to debt on the books. Interest rates are going up right now. So we will be faced with double — number one, we will have a higher interest and depreciation costs on our books. At the same time, the plant will have to be stopped, because you can’t have a plant and keep it empty. So it will be a drain on the books if there is no demand recovery coming up. So it’s a question of how to balance these two sites at any point of time. We feel that we have a adequate potential to accommodate up to 20%, 25% growth in our existing plants. And probably another 10% growth can be accommodated by outsourcing certain products. So we have a upper leeway of accommodating growth everything up to 30%, 35%. So with this kind of a leeway, we would prefer to not put ourselves in a situation where we are pleased with increasing cost, with no revenue earning potential on the horizon.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"And second part with regard to the customer dynamics, so there has been definitely a change, we find that there are some customers who are buying more now. And at the same time, when we say, the top 10 customers or top 15 customers even the mix of those customers is changing right now for us. And that is because some major customers who bought more in earlier years are now holding onto inventory. So they are cutting down, there are some markets where customers are buying more. So it’s a very dynamic situation. And in this time, it’s — I would not like to say that this is a long-term shift, which has taken place. It’s more of a short-term and nature shift, probably it will pan out by the end of this year.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"With regard to China, you are perfectly right. China has been a very good market for us. In fact, two-year COVID accounted for close to about 13%, 14% of our sales. And we have seen a major drop in our sales to China. And though China is coming back right now, so from February, they’ve started opening up. Chinese customers are still not entered the market yet. It’s still lot of saying that they are holding of the stocks. So their inactivity levels for the last so many months, means that they are the people who are still holding onto stock, and this business probably will not come back for at least another six months is what we think. So probably calendar year ’23 might just go, but demand potential is being very strong in China and hopefully for ’24, it will turnout be a better year.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"With regard to the growth potential, meaning for this year, we still think that the first two quarters, we will see subdue demand. Part of it is because of countries, big country, market like China, which are still destocking. And a lot of it is also because of the currency crisis hitting a lot of economies across the countries in the world right now. So we talk about a little bit of Egypt and Pakistan and Bangladesh little earlier. But this currency crisis is actually now much more wider spread and we also see that in number of African countries, a few Latin American countries and not having currently means that customers are not able to get the currency to import goods. So there is some demand in these countries, we are still not able to book the order because they are not able to open LCs.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So hopefully, this situation will also normalized it’s something which is come off by spending too much money is what I guess, in the last three years during COVID. So we will see a recovery coming in back. But the basic demand requirement exist and probably just a blip of a year or two, which will see now.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Does that answer your question?,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Dwanil Desai — Turtle Capital — Analyst,So do we expect the same level of revenue or we expecting growth or we are not taking any view right now?,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,I’m unable to give any guidance on that for the current year.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Dwanil Desai — Turtle Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Okay. Got it. And just to follow-up on this capex, I think, I mean, we had paid that even though capex may take time, we will do the pilot thing ready so that we can start taking validation batches and [Technical Issues] that process also been slowed down or that is continuing as it is.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"It is continuing, meaning that is not been stopped. But again, as I said, we are doing it at the little slower pace. So it might be in sort of the first quarter of ’24, probably might come up in the second quarter of ’24.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Dwanil Desai — Turtle Capital — Analyst,Right. But idea is still that we will have validation and everything completed by the time the plant is ready to commercialize?,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Yeah. That is the intension. Yes.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Dwanil Desai — Turtle Capital — Analyst,Okay. Okay. Got it. Thanks.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Rajat Sethia with ithoughtpms. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rajat Sethia — ithoughtpms — Analyst,Thanks for the opportunity. Am I audible?,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yes, you are.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rajat Sethia — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Okay. Thanks. First of all, sir, big thanks to you and whole NGL team for brilliantly executing during these tough times. We are sailing back to the normal levels of margin although still some room to grow from there — here. However, the way we have kept our opex, operating expenditure in control this year despite the slowdown it’s been commendable. Thank you so much for that. Coming to the questions. The first question is about the new products that we have launched. One, if you can talk about the competitive scenario on these products? And secondly, I think sometime in the past, we had mentioned back some of the new products will be high volumes and low price products where probably the market size overall is very rigid. And for the first time, as the company, we would be entering such space. So if you — if that understanding is correct, if you can help us understand, how are we going to — what’s outstanding in terms of making the main cross in this kind of a market? And sir, second question is, how is the raw material price scenario compared to — I mean, how are the raw material prices compared to the pre-COVID levels? Are we back to those levels or are you still above that?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rajat Sethia — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"And similarly for power and fuel cost, where are we right now compared to pre-COVID and do you expect any breath from here onwards. But do you think now prices have stabilized and don’t expect any downward movement? Then sir, the next question is about top three products which contribute I think around 50% of our sales. So how is the competition in these three products right now in terms of any new player coming in or any — you talked about that there is pricing pressure for sure. Other than that anything different in the competitive scenario and do you see any risk from here onwards in the top three products and do these top three products also contribute in the same way to the margins as the — at the — you have said company level or are they lower or higher than company level? And just finally, how do you see NGL shaping up over the next five to six years? Thank you so much.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Thank you, Rajat for your questions. With regard to the new projects we are doing, the competitive scenario is great. So I’ll just give you a little bit of industry background out here. The mechanic product industry — and I’m speaking only of the API industry out there. It’s extremely, extremely rare to have production being dominated by just one or two companies. For most of the products, there would be anything from five to 15 different manufacturers based, both here in India and in China. So it’s a fairly open market with quite a lot of competition. The new products which we are doing, we are not — the first ones to come to this — these products. These are all products which are out of patent. So we definitely don’t have the first of mover advantage in these. But that has been our strategy all along, we have always falling for products which have been out of updated and it has worked out till now for us.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So the competitive scenario exist, it will remain more competitive also going forward. And especially in the current times, where demand is low, it’s definitely become more competitive and got enough pressure on pricing of the finished product also. With regard to the products which we are doing, we had mentioned that we will also — we will also add a few of the high-volume products to our product basket, which may lead to lower margins for those products. Those have yet not been commercialized. So those are still in the pilot plant phase. And we hope to have that commercialized later — in the later part of the current year.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"With regard to raw material scenario, prices are definitely not at pre-COVID level but just post-COVID and especially after the Russia, Ukraine crisis which took place, raw material prices at peak around May ’22. And from the pre-COVID level, they had bought up by almost varying from product-to-product, anything from a 200% increase up towards 350% increase. And they have come down now though not at the pre-COVID level, they are roughly in the range of about 50% to 75% higher prices than the pre-COVID levels. But prices have been coming down and especially in the last four months, especially in Q4 last year, they came down substantially, when China came back on stream.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Power and fuel cost. Power cost is stable. There is not much change in the power cost but fuel costs are up. We moved over to clean fuel about three years ago and because of the gas shortage going on. Gas prices have not come down though oil prices have come down now. So we continue to face pressure on the fuel cost upfront. On our top three products, we are not sole producers there are at least five to six competitors in almost all of them. They are new companies trying to enter the product also. In fact, there have been two new companies were strive to enter these products during the last year. So the cognitive continues, there is no — it’s cognitive risk always exist. It is our [Technical Issues]. It is our thought process and our effort to ensure that we keep and retain our market in these products and we have been successful sorted now.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"With regard to NGL shaping up over the next five to six years, yes, we are. We have product plans for expansion. We hope to get our products registered in Europe and start approaching that market also, which we have not posted now, which will definitely due to the new facility. So there is ample opportunity for growth available in this market and we look forward to growing in these markets in the next five to six years.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rajat Sethia — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Sure. Thank you so much for the detailed answer sir, preaching of the question. Then wanted to follow-up, so for the raw material prices, do you expect them to come back to pre-COVID levels and some of the lead our gross margin to come back to, what we were doing, say 55% plus?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"It’s really difficult to answer that question, because commodity chemical prices are actually over here. So the prices are still high. So I would like caustic also which used to be in the range of about 30, 35 still at 50 plus prices. But then they’re gone up to almost 85 plus. So in a way it’s come down substantially from that peak. But it is still high. So we have to see how it plays out. It’s not something, which it’s not easy for me to answer that question.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rajat Sethia — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Sure. With regards to the European registration, so whenever we decide to do it within your initial — how long does it really take for the funds to find the registration, how long does it take for the approval? And secondly, what’s the cost of registration annually?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So we have actually already filed for the European registrations for three of our products. We did this filing last year. Pre-COVID, it used to take anything from eight months to 12 months to get this approvals, but post-COVID, they are taking as long as 18 months to give approval. We hope to have registration approvals by the end of this year, calendar year for three products. We plan to file for another three products by the end of this year. So those approvals will come to it and hopefully in 2025. And this is being done from our existing plants right now.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rajat Sethia — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Okay. I think these are plants specific, right? [Speech Overlap]",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,"Sorry to interrupt you. Once again, could you please jump in the queue?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rajat Sethia — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Yeah. Yeah, thank you so much.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from S. Chatterjee with Astra Capital. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
S. Chatterjee — Astra Capital — Analyst,"Hi, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. I have two questions. One of it is, if we look at the broader picture, say let’s see, yes, in FY’26, whenever [Technical Issues]",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Voice is not coming through very clearly.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
S. Chatterjee — Astra Capital — Analyst,Hello. Is it better now?,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yeah, this is better.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
S. Chatterjee — Astra Capital — Analyst,"Yeah. I’m saying, if we look at the broader picture three years in FY’26 by now our Tarapur facilities commissioned and we are also increasing our outsourcing. So and then we can get back to our earlier margins like 20% to 25% which used to be the guidance and our revenue can also go up INR650 crores, right, approximately?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,So we have always maintained that in this market 25% plus EBITDA margins are virtually difficult to meet. We have already given a guidance of from 17% to 23% is what we aim to achieve.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
S. Chatterjee — Astra Capital — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Okay. And my second question is, in recent times, we have seen — we are going for poultry and companion animals also, earlier it used to be only for farm animals. So say, over a period of five years, can we see significant revenue income this poultry and companion animals? Is for companion animals margins are better? That’s my last question, sir.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yes. So what happens is that most of the APIs which are used for farm animals also can be used for companion animals. And this is true with regard to our [Indecipherable] with regard to antipyretics. So the APIs are the same, it is only the end use with changes. So and there are very few which are exclusively for companion animals. Most of the — have various life fungibilities. Now most of the biggest market for companion animals lies in Europe and in the U.S. So when we start registering our products over there that those are — customers who are in the end selling for those markets, we will be able to approach them also.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Most of the year have at various life [Indecipherable]duties. Now most of the biggest market for companion animals, lies in Europe and in the US. So when we start registering our products over there that those are for those markets. We will be able to approach them also.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
S. Chatterjee — Astra Capital — Analyst,"Okay, sir. We shouldn’t see currently our formulation partners are mainly catering to farm animals, right? They are not very much into companion animal.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"That is right, yes.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
S. Chatterjee — Astra Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay, sir. Thank you. Thank you and good luck for the year. Thank you, sir.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tarun [Indecipherable] with Finnish Capital. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Tarun Sancheti — Sancheti Capital — Analyst,"Hi, sir, am I audible?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yes, you are.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Tarun Sancheti — Sancheti Capital — Analyst,"Well, congratulations for a great set of number. Just one clarification. My name is would be Tarun Sancheti, I am from Sancheti Capital. So coming to the question, I think in response to one of the previous participant question, you mentioned about pre-filing for European Union. I do understand that you have CP filing for three products. Wanted to check the status of that. Have we received approval for European region?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Approvals are not received. No.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Tarun Sancheti — Sancheti Capital — Analyst,Okay. So can you tell timeline by which we can really see the approval for those products?,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,We hope to see it by end of this calendar year.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Tarun Sancheti — Sancheti Capital — Analyst,"Okay. And directionally from a market perspective, and I do understand that couple of products are very limited competition out of those, so how big that market opportunity on those particular products would be? If you can add some color on that.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yes. See the market opportunities large for these products, but there are already existing companies entrants in there. We are not the first to supply. So there are Chinese companies and Indian companies are already in it. Mainly, the competition comes from China in this, because they are over 90% of the market when it comes to supply to the Europe and U.S.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Tarun Sancheti — Sancheti Capital — Analyst,"I was going through this EDQM database and looks like at least as of today, there would be one or two products, then there is a very limited competition. So are you seeing that few people have already registered and they’ll get approval before us? Is that the way to rate it?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"There are at least five, six companies who have already registered those products. They already have a CEP.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Tarun Sancheti — Sancheti Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay, fair enough. Thank you. That is all.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Rohit with ithoughtpms. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rohit — ithoughtpms — Analyst,Hello.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Yes.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rohit — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Hello. Yeah, hi Rahul. So Rahul, just — I mean, most of the questions have been answered, but just to understand this whole cycle better, so I mean, in the — if you look at the history of our company last 10, 12 years and even past in action you’ve always maintained and used to maintaining that — I mean, there is steady demand for our kind of products and one would also understand that given the kind of end user industry that we cater to. So just want to understand in the last two, three years, what exactly really happened, I mean, is it like the demand what pull forward and people want to do buy a lot and hence they — because of the uncertainty, I mean, if you can share a bit on that, that will really help and in your — you’ve been in this business for a very long time. And how does it unraveled usually. I mean, just related to that in terms of supply side. How are your competitors going through these tough times and if you can share a bit on that, that will really help us understand this scenario better? You already answered, but just a bit more detail.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yes. See, COVID was a game changer for many things out here, with lockdown and supply disruption which took place. So we saw for extended period of time, transportation came at — standstill, manufacturing was — had slowed down. And then just when we were recovering from COVID eight months, 10 months later, there was the second wave, which came out. And then there was a bit of worry across many countries. What happens if there is a third wave and second wave — sorry fourth wave? So during ’22, we saw — ’21 and ’22, we saw large growth in the demand from many countries and customers and since it was a medical emergency, there was a feeling that people should stock up on medicines as much as they can.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"And probably most of the companies out here sort of miscalculated the whole thing. And third and fourth waves really did not materialize, did not meet to any logistical problems. Operations went down as they were the vaccine came out. And people will left with holding large amount of stocks that people actually bought so large part of our growth from ’20 to ’22, we went from INR150 crores to INR315 crores, lot of it was — not just by the normal growth of the market, but by requirement for people to have stock, so that they could even though if any logistical problems if at all, which come up, and they did not come at all.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So that last year, we have seeing that companies are more or less — all those companies which held up with large stocks have more or less registered providing and there are just now destocking their inventories. And wherever we see that destocking has taken place now, there is a new problem, with regard to currency issues, which customers are facing. So these are things which are affecting the demand right now. And again, it is more like a short-term trend. And by short-term, I don’t mean couple of months, but it’s something which is — which will take probably a couple of years to unravel. We are already good year plus into that cycle right now. And it should probably continue maximum till the end of this year is what our feeling is.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rohit — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Right. And just I mean, do any — do you think that given the end nature of these products, which are sort of most necessity and in the normal pass course of ones’ life and given that we had a COVID disruption and now we have issues like currency crisis and macro recession in country. Do you see the sort of whenever things resolve back — again — the spring will again recoil and whatever excess — whatever demand which is being curtail sort of comeback very fast, is that understanding correct or and we have a similar situation what we saw maybe not to that extent, but something like this revert back to which we go back to the other side of the slide — other side of the chart, very fast. Is that understanding correct or?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Yeah. As of when the cycle completed — then we should see the demand coming back.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rohit — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Sure. And can you talk a bit on the supply side as well or there, how are other companies managing or are you seeing some companies sort of going out of business or going through a lot of stress given the last 1.5 years has been very challenging?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So low prices doesn’t mean that companies, which are not very competitive and cannot — will definitely face pressures on their margin and profitability and once the product becomes unviable, we will definitely see a chain where people will go ahead. So it’s a sort of thing which keeps on repeating itself in this pharma industry and we’ve been seeing it almost 35 years now, where companies come in, stay with the product for a few years, go out, when they go out, somebody else starts coming in. It’s really not — it’s a cycle which keeps repeating itself over a period of time.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rohit — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Got it. And just one last question, I mean, our top three products, top five products and top three clients and top five clients in this quarter has gone up quite a bit. Is there, I mean, is that more a quarterly aberration or how do we gain share in these products within our existing clients as well, so if you can just talk a bit about that?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,No. It is quarter-to-quarter really does not give comparison in this industry.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rohit — ithoughtpms — Analyst,"Sure. Thank you, Rahul. All the very best for the coming year.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,Thank you.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Rushabh with Equirus PMS. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rushabh — Equirus PMS — Analyst,"Yeah, hello. Am I audible?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,If you can be a little bit Louder.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rushabh — Equirus PMS — Analyst,"Just one minute. Yeah, am I audible now?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yes, this is better.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rushabh — Equirus PMS — Analyst,"Yeah. Just a small question on the Tarapur expansion. So for the year, you have planned a INR100 crore expansion and then due to inflation, it would be around INR140 crores to INR150 crores, it was expected to start in November of last year. So just wanted to know how much have we spent as of the date and have we taken any debt for that?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"Yeah. As of 31 March, our total expenditure on the Tarapur project was INR25 crores. And advance is given to the suppliers were another INR6 crores. So we had spend about INR31 crores and there was zero debt taken for that.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rushabh — Equirus PMS — Analyst,Okay. Okay. Thanks. That’s all. Thanks.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of [Indecipherable] with Swan Investments. Please go ahead.,NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,"Hi sir, thanks for the opportunity. I’m fairly new to the company, so pardon me, if my question seem a bit vague. So with Tarapur expansion, what is your capacity post the expansion and when is it expected to start as of now?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So we haven’t put a date on where we would expect to start, as I said, we are just playing a wait-and-watch game right now. As and when we see demand coming back, that is the time will trigger the — and accelerate the entire expansion. Until then, we are going at a slower pace, so that we can fund the entire thing from internal accruals rather than from [Indecipherable].",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,"And sir, what would be a capacity post the expansion?",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Rahul Nachane — Managing Director,"So typically, this industry has a capital asset turnover ratio anything from two to three. Let’s say between 2 and 2.5 would be a good average if we think about. So INR150 crore investment, we should be able to generate probably in the range of INR350 crores to INR400 crores turnover.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,"Thanks a lot, sir. Thank you.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I now hand over the call to Mr. Rahul Nachane for the closing comments.",NGLFINE,NGL FINE-CHEM LTD

Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to the Investor Call of Cosmo First Limited to discuss the Q4 FY ’23 results. Today, we have with us from the management, Group CEO, Pankaj Poddar and Group CFO, Mr. Neeraj Jain.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,"Starting off with the statutory declaration, certain statements in the conference call may be forward-looking. These statements are based on management’s current expectation and are subject to uncertainties and changes in circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of future results. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,"Now, may I request Mr. Neeraj Jain to take us through his opening remarks, subsequent to which we can open the floor for the Q&A. Thank you and over to you Mr. Jain.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you very much. Very good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I’m Neeraj Jain, Group CFO at Cosmo First, along with my colleague Mr. Pankaj Poddar, Group CEO at Cosmo First. Both our financial results as well as the Investors Presentation are available on Company’s website, we hope you could go through these.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We’ll start the call with a brief on the performance of the Company for the quarter four, which may be followed by questions. So, first talking about the flexible packaging business, although quarter four was a fairly challenging quarter primarily for the commodity part of the business, our company could still post 10% EBITDA on the back of the specialty film portfolio. The results have clearly outperformed compared to the industry.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"During the quarter, commodity films margins both on the BOPP and BOPET witnessed a further decline compared to the previous quarter, impairing the profitability of the entire industry. You will notice that from last couple of quarters BOPP and BOPET industry faced excess supply scenario caused due to bunching of several new production lines together.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Although demand side continues to grow, the bunching of supply caused margin drop and impacted everyone in the industry. Cosmo with over two-third of its revenue coming from the specialty film could withstand the margin pressure and clearly outperformed the industry once again in the quarter four. BOPP film margin has been running close to INR10 rupees per kg in March 2023 quarter compared to INR17 per kg in December ’22 quarter and INR50 per kg in March ’22 quarter. So, very significant gap in the commodity part of the business.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"You would also notice that this margin of INR10 per kg is quite low compared to average historical margin this industry has been earning, which has been close to INR25 per kg. It may also be noted that in such a challenging market, the company’s specialty margins remain broadly intact in line with the last year. While the commodity margin has gone down to one-fifth of the last year margin, but specialty margins remained fairly flat. Semi specialty product category margins are also down by almost 40% compared to last year. All of these details are available in our investors presentation.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Coming to BOPET line which was commissioned in FY ’23, which continue to focus on the perfecting recipes, processes and quality parameter on various specialty and value-add films. This is in line with the company’s larger strategy to enter into the polyester film. There was about INR5 crore rupees of EBITDA loss in BOPET during the quarter. The company is working on the key specialty product on the BOPET line, which are expected to deliver results within FY ’24.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"With objective to promote sustainability and rationalize cost, the company has entered into renewable power agreement to source 40% of fixed power requirement for its largest plant through renewable sources. The power has already started from May 2023 end. Of course, beside promoting sustainability, this will also rationalize cost in a material way. In medium-term, the company is looking to source almost 50% of its power requirement through renewable sources, which will serve twin purpose of sustainability as well as the cost specialization.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Moving to flexible packaging outlook for the coming months and the quarter. So the company expects the position to improve in the coming months, bringing an end to the quarter-to-quarter decline which has been happening from last three quarters continuously in a row. So there’s already a marginal uptick we have seen in May 2023 quarter — not quarter, month actually margins. So, beside its specialty sales, the Foundation clearly focus on cost rationalization measures in FY ’24.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The company has launched several new specialty film including shrink for packaging and non-packaging applications. Film — other specialty film for non-packaging applications are also in pipeline, which should hit the market in the coming quarters. All these would of course will strengthen the company’s position in the specialty film business. We’ll continue to build on specialty product portfolio to maintain the lead over the industry in the coming quarters as well.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Now I’m going to move to March 2023 quarter financial results. So the consolidated sales for the March ’23 quarter is INR715 crore, which is lower by about 2% compared to December ’22 quarter, although volume is higher by about 4%. This drop is mainly due to lower commodity margins and mix change. EBITDA for the March 2023 quarter is INR74 crore, compared to INR86 crore in December ’22 quarter and INR165 crore in March ’22 quarter.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The EBITDA is largely lower because of the margin which we already discussed. The results also include operating losses of the pet care division. Despite drop in the quarter earnings, our financial remains fairly strong, with annualized ROCE of 16% and return-on-equity of 20%, which is of course on the leading side in the entire industry.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Now we are going to move the specialty film update. Well if you notice, specialty film sale has been growing for us from last four year almost with 13% CAGR growth rate. The specialty growth remained broadly flat in FY ’23 and that did got slightly impacted in second half of FY ’23, mainly due to inventory correction in some export markets, primarily in the Europe and the U.S. The company expect its specialty to improve and recover in FY ’24. And of course, we are targeting double-digit in specialty from sales growth in FY ’24.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"On BOPET side also, the company is in process of launching serval new specialty products, including heat control film, security film and PET-G films. Heat control film is scheduled to be in market in second half of current financial year. The film will go through the various certification processes and parallelly completion, create a distribution network of dealers. And in the Phase one, we will focus primarily on the Tier 1 cities.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Now we are moving towards flexible packaging growth projects, where the company is working. So as we discussed in the past, work on BOPP and CPP line is progressing in-line with the plan. Both the lines are world’s largest production capacity lines and will increase company’s existing capacity by almost 45% in a phased manner by March 2025.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"With high speed large decline, it will rationalize cost of production between 3% to 5% compared to current cost of production, depending on the products. So CPP line and BOPP line, of course beside adding the capacity significantly, it will also promote sustainability, because as both the lines will offer mono-layered structure.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Moving to subsidiary, on specialty chemical side, the company’s subsidiary into specialty chemical posted INR35 crore of sales during March ’23 quarter, which is 17% higher compared to similar quarter last year. During FY ’23, specialty chemicals subsidiary has done overall INR159 crore of sales, which is 75% higher compared to last year. The Company could reach almost 75% capacity utilization on its masterbatch line, and of course, beside this, complementary adhesive business for the packaging segment is all set to grow in current financial.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Moving to pet care division, the Company’s direct-to-consumer vertical which was launched under brand Zigly in September 2021 is progressing in line with the plan. The Company has already started 15 experience centers at March ’23 end and this is of course beside the sales through online portal and online app. The current monthly GMV for the Zigly is close to INR2 crore, which we are targeting to be 10 times growth in next couple of years. FY ’23 GMV for Zigly division is INR13 crore, which is of course nine times compared to last year sales.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Zigly so far has served more than 23,000 customers already. And of course, we have one-third of the repeat customers. The Company’s focus for Zigly shall continue to be to grow it multiple times in next couple of years. Beside organic growth, the Company is also looking for inorganic growth in — for Zigly. So an acquisition opportunity in online pet care space is almost at the final stage and we expect it to close soon. This would further accelerate the Company’s growth in the pet care vertical. We will be able to share more detail about it once we freeze on the agreement in due course. So overall for Zigly, it’s all set to make a substantial impact in India’s Pet Care industry.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Now we move to growth and debt level in the Company. Company is looking to almost INR500 crore to INR550 crores of capex in a phased manner by March 2025, which will be largely only value-add capex on the BOPET line, CPP line and BOPP line. The current net debt of the Company is INR433 crores at March ’23 end, which is 0.3 times of net debt-to-equity and 1 time of net-debt-to-EBITDA, so fairly healthy financial.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Now of course, in the last but not the least, moving to corporate announcements. The Board of Directors has recommended INR5 per equity share dividend for financial year ’23. This of course is subject to approval of shareholders in upcoming Annual General Meeting. This dividend coupled with 1:2 bonus given in June 2022, along with the buyback of shares done in February 2023, reaffirms Company’s commitment to provide regular return and share prosperity with the stakeholders.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So, I think those were the updates for the quarter. Now, we would like to open the call for questions please.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,Questions and Answers:,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Shubham Agarwal from Aequitas Investment Consultancy. Please go ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. Sir, my first question is related to the spread, you mentioned that last quarter it was INR10. So I just wanted to understand what is the current trend, given that you mentioned that there is some recovery. So what is the current spreads trending and how do we look at the spread for the rest of the year?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Well actually, Shubham, we are not very sure, since it’s a forward-looking statement, whether we should be able to share the current margins trend. All we can also add here is, there is a margins uptick we have seen in the May 2023 performance from the last quarter.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,"Okay, but any — like directionally, how do you see it, given that this year there are two new lines and next year there are five more lines expected to come up. Given the current demand scenario, if you can just help us understand how do we look at this industry?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So, you see — I mean there is already an industry base which has been growing close to 10% year-on-year. So in any case, industry needs two production lines minimum each year just to sustain the new growth. So, from that perspective FY ’24 new two lines should not be — should not impact much. But of course you know if bunching of line happens in FY ’25, this may create some pressure temporary for couple of quarters. But other than this, we see over a period of time, a balanced demand-supply scenario to come back.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,"So, given that the margins have remained so low, have you seen any closure of inefficient plants in India?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Well, Cosmo’s all lines are running full. So, we are — except the maintenance shutdown, we have been able to run all the lines fully during the quarter.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,"No, I’m talking about the industry level, if you have any idea?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Well, there will be some closure at the end-of-the industry. But so far, Cosmo has been able to run our lines fully.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,"Got it, got it. And secondly, on the specialty sales. So for FY ’23, we did some 62% in terms of specialty. Now, this also includes semi-specialty, right? So what is the percentage of actual specialty in this 62%?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So, very broadly it’s one-third, one-third, one-third; one-third is specialty, one-third semi-specialty, and one-third commodity part of it.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,Okay. And would it be possible for you to share the finished specialty spread for the current quarter compared to last quarter?,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,That should be available in our investor presentation.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,"Okay. No — so, in the investor presentation, it is given year-wise. So, it is close to 40% compared to last 50%. I wanted to understand Q-on-Q.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We can share separately, but you know will be little difficult to reconcile on the con-call.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,"No problem. And lastly, on the demand side on specialty, how do you expect it to grow for the current year given that last year we were flattish?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"There are very exciting products in pipeline on the specialty side. So, company is quite optimistic about the specialty growth in current financial year.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,"Okay. So, double-digit is something you are mentioning?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,Say again please.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,"No, it’s okay. And lastly on the pet care business. On the acquisition side, you said that something is on the pipeline. So, what is the total amount earmarked for acquisitions in the current year?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So it will not be very substantial amount from the pay-out perspective. But what we are looking for more strategic segment and that adds value. So our acquisition strategy for the Zigly, you will notice, in alignment to these key parameters. But from the pay-out perspective, it will not be very significant amount. We will of course share much more detail once we sign the final agreement.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,Got it. But what is the specific capabilities that we are trying to address with this acquisition?,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"If you notice, I mean, the channel which we are trying to create in the Zigly is through the retail distribution as well as the online sales. So in either of these two, a good fitment which accelerate the overall growth, with a higher kind of the volume. So that’s the primary strategy we’re looking for within this group.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Shubham Agarwal — Aequitas Investment Consultancy — Analyst,"Okay, fair enough, sir. Thank you, I’ll come back in the queue.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sagar Shah from PhillipCapital DCG. Please go ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Sagar Shah — PhillipCapital DCG — Analyst,"Hello sir. Good afternoon. I had just couple of questions. My first question is, can you give the volume numbers for this quarter.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,"[Speech Overlap] disturbance that is coming from your line sir, from the background.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Sagar Shah — PhillipCapital DCG — Analyst,"Yeah, sure. Better?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,Yeah.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Sagar Shah — PhillipCapital DCG — Analyst,"So, basically, can you give us the volume numbers for this quarter for specialty films and for the commodity films?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, in percentage terms, so that is also available in our investor presentation. As I said, it’s broadly one-third, one-third, one-third kind of the portfolio. There may be some up or down in a specific quarter, but very broadly that’s the count.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Sagar Shah — PhillipCapital DCG — Analyst,"Okay sir. Okay, and just secondly, I wanted to understand on the demand front, is the demand right now improving, especially from the FMCG sector?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"I mean, see a large part of our films goes to consumption-driven kind of industries including FMCG, tape sector, textile sector. So, demand-side we do not see any kind of issue. The whole of the commodity part of the business got impacted largely because of the supply-side came with a short-time distance, so bunching happened over there, which we see, since the demand side has been growing close to 10% year-on-year, so we see that temporarily gap should get mitigated over the coming quarters of the year.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Sagar Shah — PhillipCapital DCG — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Okay. That’s all from me. Thank you so much.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amit Agarwal from Leeway Investments. Please go ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Amit Agarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Good afternoon. Sir, my first question is regarding — sir, specialty products. Since 60% of products are specialty products and they’re priced at cost of raw material plus fixed margin. Is it fair to assume that higher margins are only possible if oil prices rise from current levels?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Sorry, you need to repeat your last part of your question?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Amit Agarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Sir, is it fair to assume that higher margin is only possible when oil prices rise from current levels?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Not actually, because you know — as you know for the — even for the commodity part of business also, there is a price reset mechanism available in the whole of the industry. Each 15 days basis, the raw material price get reset, and on the same day, we also revise our selling price to the customer. So in a normal balanced market there is already identified price — raw material price passing mechanism available. So, the issue these days is more because of the excess supply, but industry from the raw-material commodity perspective, it is all fairly in a mitigated way.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Amit Agarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Sir no, if the oil prices are above 100 plus, should that — that will either pass on to the raw-material costs and that will be passed on — that we have pass on to our target product also, that there is a higher turnover as well as higher margins?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,That’s true for a balanced supply scenario. The passage of the raw material cost is possible and that has been happening.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Amit Agarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Okay. And my second question is, sir, for last two month, we haven’t open a new Zigly store. So are we able to meet our original planning to meet our target of 30 to 40 stores by the end of this year?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So, we announced for FY ’23-end we should be having close to 15 new stores, which is the number we targeted and we achieved also. For the current financial year, of course, we are looking for a steady growth again in terms of the both the retail presence as well as the online sale. So, we should be able to almost double the number of the stores in current financial.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Amit Agarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Earlier we were targeting for around 40 stores, if I’m not wrong?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"That will happen over a period of time, not for the current financial year.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Amit Agarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Okay, and my last question is, sir how much has been the loss in this quarter related to pet car business, in this last quarter?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Sorry, again, you need to repeat your question?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Amit Agarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Sir, how much has been the loss of pet care business in this last quarter?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"You’ll refer, if our segmental reporting, all of it has you know quarter-wise and year-wise numbers. So primarily the segment of others indicate the — in terms of the profitability, the pet care division.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Amit Agarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"So won’t like to give the — last time you gave that like — you know this much loss, last time you were able to give us the amount.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"No, I’m sorry, not able to understand your question.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Amit Agarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Last quarter you were able to give the exact amount, how much we lost in the third quarter in pet care business. So is it possible to give it right now.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,[Speech Overlap] That number is available in the segmental reporting. It should have been closer to INR7 crores.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Amit Agarwal — Leeway Investments — Analyst,"Okay, thank you. That’s it. Thank you.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Harsh Mulchandani from Kriis Portfolio. Please go ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Harsh Mulchandani — Kriis Portfolio — Analyst,"Thank you for the opportunity. I wanted to understand how do we plan to utilize the upcoming capex? Like for example, heat control films or shirk pads. I think there are already competitors who are into this stream already. So, how do we plan to take market share from them and do we have any contracts in place or what strategy will be going-forward to make sure that your lines are able to run at optimum utilization? That’s my first question and then I’ll come to the second one.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, Window films is a consumer product, and it does take time to scale it up. We have spent good three years to do lot of research to make some very innovative films, when it comes to window films, there are already six-seven different category of products. We are expected to launch this in quarter two. And as I said, consumer products do take time. It’s not about capacity utilization, it’s more about building sales. As we have said earlier, this is a high-margin product category. But building sales is the main, I would say challenge along with building the right products. So we have already surpassed the right product. Important is to build-up sales and educate consumers in terms of the benefit of window films.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Harsh Mulchandani — Kriis Portfolio — Analyst,"Got it, got it. So you’re trying — so, in a nutshell, your product is at par or better than the competitors. And then it will take, is it fair to assume, couple of years to scale up the sales because it’ll be more on the retail side?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, we do feel that every year there should be ramp-up in sales. Right now, important thing is, in a country like India, very few customers take the advantage of window film. And it can reduce the room temperature anywhere between 4 degree Celsius to 18 degrees Celsius, depending on the film that is being used. So first important task is to educate the customers so that you know they get aware and they get interested in buying this kind of a product.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Today, most homes in India, do not use — homes or offices or factories, do not use window films and the penetration is far lesser versus America. I mean America today, we know is a much colder country than India, and the way the Indian temperatures are there, I feel every home, every office, every factory should have a window film, which unfortunately is not the case. So with proper education, we feel that the market can expand many, many fold.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Harsh Mulchandani — Kriis Portfolio — Analyst,"Fair, fair, fair. And similarly, like in the other specialty products also which you are building what I heard from the initial opening remarks was I think into shrink pad products and shrink films and I think one more product you mentioned. So again, similar strategy that even those will take some time to ramp — like breakthrough and as of today, there is no breakthrough as such in terms of getting sales. Is that understanding correct?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"For shrink, already sales have started coming. And lot of our products which we were already having expertise in BOPP, we are able to have sales for them in BOPET. We’ve also developed a very innovative product for microwave oven. That product also we have recently launched and I mean, as per our internal studies, it has come out very well. So, we continue to bring new products to the market and build our specialty portfolio.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Harsh Mulchandani — Kriis Portfolio — Analyst,"Got it. Just last one question, where do we see ourselves five years down the line with respect to specialty percentage of sales? Like right now, it’s around one third. So, do we expect it to be more than half of our sales, say five years down or that is challenging to achieve?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, we always combine specialty and semi-specialty because even in semi-specialty, we earn more margins. See, as we had earlier said that we intend to take this number to 80% on a run rate and 75% for the full-year basis. You know what will really happen is in another two years’ time, we’re adding lot of capacity in terms of BOPP, CPP. And again, we’ll have to start building sales for that. So it’s an ongoing task. We intend to bring every new line once the existing capacity largely move to specialty products. So five years from now, it will be fair to say that we’ll be sitting somewhere close to 60%, 70% of overall specialty plus semi-specialty sales.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Harsh Mulchandani — Kriis Portfolio — Analyst,"Got it, got it. So mix would be more or less similar even from here, going forward, because you’ll add capacities across the spectrum.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, yeah.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Harsh Mulchandani — Kriis Portfolio — Analyst,Got it. Fair. Thank you so much. Thank you.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Nirav Savai from Abakkus Asset Management. Please go ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Nirav Savai — Abakkus Asset Management — Analyst,"Hi, sir. Actually just missed your initial remarks on the spread. You said it’s about INR10 for the quarter and what was it in the previous quarter and last year Q4?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"For the previous quarter, it was INR17 per kg and last year similar quarter it was INR50 per kg.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Nirav Savai — Abakkus Asset Management — Analyst,"Right, right. So, with the kind of new capacities coming in, you said there are two new lines which are going to come in FY ’24. So what is the base case which you all are assuming internally. What can be the possible margins? Any guidance if you can provide?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So, again — first of all, we do not provide any future guidance. All I can share here is March ’23 quarter looks it bottomed out because you know margins have been running closer to the EBITDA breakeven even for the BOPP part of the business. For the corporate part of the business, it was negative EBTIDA. You might have noticed in some of the peer group results, there is a very clear evidence to what we are saying. So to sum up, we did see already it has bottomed out. It should — there should be uptick in the margins, which we witnessed very recently, marginal uptick, will be May 2023 per-tax.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Nirav Savai — Abakkus Asset Management — Analyst,"Understood sir. And second thing was you said commodity margins were one-fifth of specialty margin this quarter, is it right? For average of margins?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So compared to last year similar quarter, commodity margins were running one-fifth of the margins.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Nirav Savai — Abakkus Asset Management — Analyst,"Right. Right, right. And sir shrink film, any number if you can provide, what is the size of the opportunity in India and what can be the potential revenue which we can get in that business in the next two, three years or maybe just the overall size of industry in India for shrink films?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"It can become a very large market. You see there is a market of 30,000 metric ton PVC films, which we feel shirk film over a period of time should largely replace because there are recyclability related issues in the PVC film, which with high shrink Pet-G film should be able to address much more.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Nirav Savai — Abakkus Asset Management — Analyst,"Okay, but any number, if you can provide, any — what would be the current size right now, which is our principal market?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Our market is 150,000 tons for Pet-G shrink films.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Nirav Savai — Abakkus Asset Management — Analyst,"So about 150,000 tons. And in terms of value, if you can provide any data?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, if you largely multiply it by INR300, INR350, you will get the market.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Nirav Savai — Abakkus Asset Management — Analyst,"Right, I got it. Perfect. That’s it from my side. Thank you very much.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Harsh Sheth from HDFC Securities. Please go ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Harsh Sheth — HDFC Securities — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. Just one question…",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,"Sir, sorry to interrupt, but the volume for you is very low. We request you to please speak closer to the mike.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Harsh Sheth — HDFC Securities — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. So, I just wanted to understand what is the current breakup of exports and domestic sales and which are the geographies we are planning to expand in the next year. That’s my first question.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, export and domestic is close to 50:50. Our biggest target market is Americas.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Harsh Sheth — HDFC Securities — Analyst,"Thank you. And sir you did mention about working with certain FMCG companies on introducing or you know — on introducing certain kind of products, you’ve been — your R&D team has been working closely with large FMCG players. So, just wanted to know where do we stand in product approval stage. What kind of products are we planning to come out with. And then, when can we expect that to roll-out. If you could throw some light on that and the opportunities?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We’re also working with the largest FMCG player in the country. We have been very successful in signing the contract for the next year. We have already developed eight to nine products for them and continue to develop more products, many of them are really very-very innovative, done for the first time in the world. Similarly, for another very large FMCG player, we have again done development and they are now expecting a next level of development, which is also in the pipeline. Barring this, again for some of the very large brands, five or six other brands, there is lot of work which has happened in the past and more work is still in the pipeline.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Harsh Sheth — HDFC Securities — Analyst,Right. That’s it from my side.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Vipul Shah from Sumangal Investments. Please go ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"Hi sir. So, this BOPP line and CPP line, which we are planning to complete in 2025, so what type of capacity addition will we see from those lines?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, both put together should be close to 80,000 tons.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"Both put together, 80,000 tons?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,Yeah.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"Okay, and what type of ROE and ROCE we can expect from that line, sir?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So see, in a normal market, the payback period should be close to four years.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"In a normal market? Okay. And sir, what will be the capex for chemical business and this pet care business for next two, three years?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Zigly business will entail anywhere between INR100 crores to INR150 crores. As far as chemical business is concerned, we still can — close to double the revenue from the existing capex. So there may not be any major capex involved, until we achieve 80% utilization.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"Okay, so only pet care division will have a capex of INR100 crores around?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, INR100 crores to INR150 crores, not necessarily capex, it includes operational losses as well.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"So, put all three divisions together, what should be our peak debt, because right now the cash flows are impacted due to the market?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, we are still sitting at a very healthy position of 1:1 debt-to-EBITDA position and that do not seem to be a concern for us now.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, your capex for BOPET line is INR100 crores or INR450 crores because in two different slides, two different figures are given, so, please clarify.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Both cost and the balance capex is already done. So all put together, it is INR450 crores.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,For BOPET line?,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, BOPET line including all the value-added assets that we’ve put along with it.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"Okay. Okay, sir. Thank you very much and all the best.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd

Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Jiten Parmar from Aurum Capital. Please go ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Jiten Parmar — Aurum Capital — Analyst,"Good afternoon. Congratulations on a decent set of numbers in a very tough environment. My question is more on, you know can you throw some light on what were the volumes, because prices have been fluctuating. So it is, we’ll be getting a better sense if we can get to know the volumes on all the three sides, basically semi-specialty, specialty and commodity.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Pankaj Poddar — Group Chief Executive Officer,"As Neeraj has already stated, they’re all in the ratio of around one-third, one-third, one-third.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Jiten Parmar — Aurum Capital — Analyst,"Yeah. So, but I’m saying, any volume last year and what is this year. Is there any change or what — if we can get the volume growth that would be great.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Pankaj Poddar — Group Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, from last year, the volume growth is 7%.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Jiten Parmar — Aurum Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay. That’s all. That’s all I had. Thank you.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Anuj Salian from — sorry Anuj Salian is an Individual Investor. Please go-ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Anuj Salian — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Yes, hi, thank you for the chance. I have few questions. First, could you tell me what kind of revenue and margins we expect from the masterbatches segment and who are the competitors in this segment, as like there are lot of small players in this and there are big players competing. So, could you tell me about the margins and revenue.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, we are largely in a film related masterbatch as of now where there are two multinational competitors and there are three local competitors, but largely the market is dominated by multinational competitors. And out of our total revenue in CSC, close to 70% revenue is coming from masterbatch.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Anuj Salian — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Okay. Okay, are we expecting anymore industry-wise capacity additions for the next couple of years?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,In which business are you saying?,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Anuj Salian — Individual Investor — Analyst,I mean just margins in the packaging business.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So, see as far as polyester is concerned, there will be some lines which are coming up in ’23 and ’24. And then after that, there are no further announcements. In BOPP, there are not many lines until ’24, I think only two lines more are coming. But in ’25 there are, I think at least six lines. But what we continue to hear is that lot of players are sensibly delaying their projects to ’26 and ’27.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Anuj Salian — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Okay, understood. And one last question on the heat control film, will this be a B2C products? And like will it be an in-house brands? Could you like to throw some light on this?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, we have already kept the brand name of Cosmos Sunshield. And it will be a consumer product for the Indian market. In the exports, we’ll treat it as a B2B product.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd

Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Varun Gupta from Augmenta Research. Please go ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Varun Gupta — Augmenta Research — Analyst,"Hi, thank you, sir, for the opportunity. First, I have two small question. The first question would be on the BOPET line right now, we’ll be only producing commodity films, right?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, our line is actually a string of label and some specialty product lines. It has the feature to run commodity products today. You are right, we are largely producing commodity products. But as we have said earlier that within three years we intend to take roughly 60% of our sales from this line to specialty products.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Varun Gupta — Augmenta Research — Analyst,"Okay, understood. And could you tell me the margins on the commodity BOPET line that we saw in Q4?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"They were negative. At EBITDA level, it had made losses.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Varun Gupta — Augmenta Research — Analyst,"Okay. And one last question on the specialty side, you mentioned that there was some inventory correction in H2 that happened. So are we done with the inventory correction or can we expect some more inventory correction will happen in Q1?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Majority of the corrections happened in quarter three and remaining correction happened in quarter four. So next quarter, we do not foresee any inventory corrections.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Varun Gupta — Augmenta Research — Analyst,"Okay, understood sir. Thank you.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Navneet Bhaiya, an Individual Investor. Please go ahead.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Hi Neeraj and hi Pankaj. So my question was again on the BOPET, are you operating at full utilization of the BOPET line, because I believe in Q3, you were holding back the utilization because of the poor market conditions?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Sorry, come back again.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"In your BOPET line, are you operating at full utilization now, because I believe in Q3, you were going a little slow on the utilization, given the poor market conditions? So, are you operating 100% now on the BOPET line?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Even in quarter four, we were not operating at full capacity. We were largely at 60%, 65%, because we are right now making lot of new products. So we are taking them from lab level to commercial level. So, I mean no, not really, utilization is 65% and even in quarter one, we don’t expect to utilize fully.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Okay, so you’ll utilize it fully only once you get…",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,"Sorry to interrupt, by the line for you is a little muffled.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,Is it better now?,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,"Yes, this is much better sir, please go-ahead.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Yeah, sorry. So you intend to utilize it fully only once your specialty BOPET films are ready. So which may take a couple of years. Is that…",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Unless film margins really get much better, we could still evaluate you know, running higher capacity. But our focus has been more of specialty products. So as you rightly pointed out, we may not useful full capacity for some time.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Understood. Can you also tell me about your masterbatches, adhesives and your chemicals utilization? Are you operating those businesses at full utilization right now or are they sub-optimal or lower than 100%?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"I mean, these are new businesses, we are just at 50% right now.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,All three of them roughly at 50%. Hello?,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, yeah, you are right 50%.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,So do you expect these to get to 100% this year or next year. When are we seeing the upside in these businesses in terms of utilization?,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"I think earliest will be ’24, ’25.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Understood. And my last question on Zigly. So you had — you mentioned you had a INR7 crore EBITDA loss [Technical Issues]. And breakeven is expected three years hence. So, what is our peak loss expected from this business? Is it annualized INR7 crores or it can go higher from here?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"It may still go higher from here. And only once we have a larger pie, then it will start coming down. So next year, it will continue to go higher. What we feel is that it can pass INR10 crores, INR12 crores per quarter. And then after that, it will start coming down.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Right. So FY ’24 could be the peak loss year, and then maybe FY ’25 it might get better.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,That is what we project as well.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Navneet Bhaiya — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Okay, fair enough. Thank you so much and all the best.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,Thank you.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Vipul Shah from Sumangal Investments. Please go ahead.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"Sir, just a little clarification, you said your BOPET line capex is INR100 crores, but in presentation you have mentioned it as INR590 crores, so can you clarify what I am missing here, sir?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So, the INR590 crore numbers includes the remaining capex on the BOPP line, CPP line and value-add assets on the BOPET line. So, all taken together is INR590 crore. You will also notice in investors presentation, there is a comment mentioned along with it, that close to INR100 crore out of it, we have already spent in March ’23 balance sheet.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"Okay. So, upon completion of this INR590 crore capex that line will be 100% specialty line.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So, I will repeat it for you. You see, we had done close to INR800 crore of capex on BOPP line, BOPET line and CPP line. Out of this, BOPP line and CPP line, major capex is yet to be done, which is largely representing in INR590 crore figure. On BOPET side, larger part of the capex has already been done in March ’23 balance sheet. Only some part of value-add asset capex is pending, which is being done in the current quarter.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"So can you quantify what will be the value-add capex for BOPET line, remaining capex?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"It should be close — remaining capex, it should be closer to INR50 crore.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"That pertains just to — just for BOPP line, right — BOPET line, sorry?",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, value-add asset on the BOPET line.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Vipul Shah — Sumangal Investments — Analyst,"Okay sir, thank you very much, yeah.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,Thank you.,COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing comments. Over to you sir.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd 
Neeraj Jain — Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you. We hope that we could address your questions appropriately. If I have to sum up, we’re pleased the strong Specialty film portfolio should continue to deliver superior returns. Although in the near-term outlook for the BOPP and BOPET films maybe little challenging. We are working parallelly on several cost rationalization and R&D projects, which should add value in coming quarters and year. Zigly is rapidly becoming well-known among the pet parents, benefiting all pet lovers and company’s stakeholders. Both for specialty side — specialty chemical side, the subsidiary should double its revenue in coming years with the launch of their new products.",COSMOFIRST,Cosmo First Ltd

I’m happy to report that for the full financial year 2023, they delivered a strong performance with revenue growing by 27.3% and profit-after-tax growing by 37.4%. During the financial year, we crossed the INR3,000 crore revenue milestone. For the fourth-quarter of the financial year 2023, our revenue from operations was rupees INR837.9 crores, which translates to a quarter-on-quarter growth of 2.5% and year-on year growth of 22.9%.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"In US dollar terms, the quarter-on-quarter growth was 2.9%. Our EBITDA for the quarter was at INR249.5 crores, which translates to an EBITDA margin of 29.8%. Our PAT for the quarter was at INR201.5 crores. In a year which had macroeconomic uncertainties and several challenges for the industry in general, we have been able to grow our revenues and protect our margins.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,I’m happy to report that the Board of Directors have recommended a final dividend of 606% for the financial year ending 31st March 2023. This represented a 42.6% increase over the previous year and corresponds to a payout ratio of 50% of our PAT.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Talking of our divisional performance for the quarter in constant-currency terms, our Embedded Product Design, our EPD division grew 1.6% quarter-on-quarter and 13% year-on year. The other two divisions IDB, and SI had a remarkable growth during the financial year. IDV grew 52.8% year-on year and our System Integration grew 77.6% year-on-year.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"And talking of the verticals, we had a steady quarter of performance for all the three verticals, but more importantly, our healthcare and the media and communication business, both have returned to growth from last quarter, even if moderately. We are building a strong deal pipeline and hope to see large deal conversions picking-up over this quarter and beyond.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Across the three verticals, our growth has been primarily volume led and we have witnessed strong growth with our large accounts. Across the key accounts, we have increased the wallet share against competition, underscoring our differentiated value proportion and offshore delivery capabilities.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"I am personally excited with the opportunity ahead in the automotive and transportation business, the scale and rate of transformation that the automotive industry needs to undertake, changes driven by the regulatory sustainability and evolving customer consumer preferences and business models, extraordinary opportunity for Tata Elxsi. This transformation will demand deep domain knowledge, scale in software development, application digital technologies like AI and IoT, and more importantly, design will take center stage in creating consumer delight.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,I believe we are at the right place and bring the right capabilities. And are engaging with the right conversations global automotive leaders in their transformation journey.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,Our strategic long-term deal with Alps Alpine in Japan to establish a global engineering center for developing next-gen mobility solutions in India and a multiyear SDB deal with a European OEM reflect this opportunity.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"I do recognize that an offshore-centric and ownership driven delivery model is not only harder to execute, but also requires almost three times the number of resources to deploy, as compared to on-site deployment for the same impact on-top line. However, we strongly believe that this is the only way to create long-term and sustainable value and we are best-positioned to deliver on this.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Equally, there is an emerging opportunity for applications around 5G that allow enterprises to harness the speed and reliability of this technology. We are seeing deals with operators and enterprises to make this a reality. Two of the large deals that we announced this quarter precisely address this opportunity, we have been selected by a leading Middle-East telecom operator as a design-led consultancy and development partner for next-gen applications around 5G, including healthcare, IoT and connected digital services. We also won a strategic deal with a world-leading telecommunications product company for 5G broadband software and solution deployment that will power the next-gen consumer devices. Our healthcare and life sciences business was impacted by the extension of regulatory deadlines, which cut into our existing work and revenues, but I’m happy to see the business recovering from the setback within a quarter, and building a strong pipeline of deals and penetrate — penetration into a new marquee customer.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"So we are seeing the success of our key strategies deployed over the last two years with strong synergies between the EPD, IDV and ISI playing out well, allowing us to address upstream and downstream product lifecycle requirements.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"We are seeing increase in duration and size of deals leading from this up-selling and cross-selling. This is reflected in the strong performance of our IDV and the system integration business in FY ’23. On the attrition front, our annualized attrition for the 4th-quarter stood at 17.3%, which is again, one of the lowest among our peers and IT industry at large. So we enter the new financial year with the confidence of working with the marquee set of global customers, scaled delivery capability from talent investments that they’ve made over the years and a unique profession of design digital that is more relevant today than ever.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"So I strongly believe we are in good shape to move forward. And I now hand over the floor to E&Y for the Q&A session. Over to you, Diwakar.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,Questions and Answers:,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Diwakar Pingle — Ernst & Young LLP. — Analyst,Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Diwakar Pingle — Ernst & Young LLP. — Analyst,[Operator instructions],TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Diwakar Pingle — Ernst & Young LLP. — Analyst,The first question is from the line of Bhavik Mehta from JP Morgan. Please go-ahead.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Bhavik Mehta — JP Morgan — Analyst,"Thank you. Couple of questions. Firstly, on the Transportation vertical, we saw a very sharp deterioration in growth on a sequential basis. So was it due to any project deferrals of unknowns[phonetic], which you saw during the quarter and what’s the outlook going into 1Q as well, in this vertical?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Bhavik Mehta — JP Morgan — Analyst,"The second question again is on the [Indecipherable] vertical, which is media and healthcare. We saw some growth coming back in 4Q, but what’s the outlook going-forward, do you expect growth to start activating from here on or do you expect it to remain maybe weaker for a couple of more quarters before we start seeing green shoots over here?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Bhavik Mehta — JP Morgan — Analyst,"And lastly, just a bookkeeping question on the ESOP, [Indecipherable] scheme in March. So what is the outlay going to be and any impact on margins because of that? Thank you.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Sure, so — so on the transportation business, I — we have one significant deal in the quarter, we have announced that. So we strongly believe that moving-forward, we have a good deal pipeline and we are seeing customer confidence in the value proportion that Tata Elxsi has. So I think from a from a transportation business, I strongly believe that that growth that we have shown over the years, we will be able to replicate that in the coming financial year. On the media and healthcare business, yes. We seen some amount of green shoots and some of the growth come back. It is still early days. I would say, but from a mid-term to long-term perspective, I see no — no challenges for us and this business will definitely recover and more important, as we see a lot more of these 5G opportunities and deals that are coming back, we strongly believe that towards the latter half of Q1 and Q2, we will see the growth coming into Tata Elxsi. So on that front, I think we are pretty, pretty confident.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Regarding ESOPs, I think, on a quarterly basis, we are looking at about INR4.5 crore or so of expenses that we would — we would incur on the ESOP front.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Bhavik Mehta — JP Morgan — Analyst,"Okay, that’s helpful. But just on the transport, what was the reason for the weakness in 4Q because 3Q was a very strong growth of 7%, now we saw only 1.5%, so any color on that would be helpful.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"No, I think you should — it’s very difficult for you to look at — it’s a large business that we have. So you don’t really look at it from a quarter-to-quarter basis in that sense. You look at it from a mid-term to long-term perspective, the fact that we have continued to grow and grow significantly over the years is what do you need to look at, I’m not really that much bothered about this one quarter issue because we definitely see strong deal pipelines and so on. There have been some amount of deferments in some of our customer places, but that, that is fine and we strongly believe that in — that growth will come back in Q1 and Q2.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Bhavik Mehta — JP Morgan — Analyst,"Okay, thank you. That’s it from my side.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we request you to restrict your questions to two per participant. For follow-up questions, you may rejoin the queue. The next question is from the line of Vimal Gohil from Alchemy Capital Management. Please go ahead.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Vimal Gohil — Alchemy Capital Management. — Analyst,"Yes, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. My questions on automotive growth has been answered. Sir, just on cash-flow despite our P&L going very strongly this year, operating cash has been slightly muted, and that is largely driven by our sharp increase in receivables. So how do you see that going-forward?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,I would request Gaurav to answer that question.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, hi, yeah, so this quarter if you see, there is an impact on our trade receivable. This is primarily because we embarked on the system transformation in the quarter four, which kind of little bit rolled over the invoicing that has to be done to the customer, but. I think that is only a short-term phenomena. We believe that that cash-flow will be back-in and we will recoup those collection in the coming quarter. So that will get normalized over the next one quarter.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Vimal Gohil — Alchemy Capital Management. — Analyst,"Understood, understood. Sir, just wanted your comments on this Alps Alpine initiative that we’ve taken, if you could just highlight something more than that. What is — what could be our revenue model and could we see some — some contribution accruing from that? I know it does signify, as you highlighted it’s a very-very significant effort — offshore effort from my side. But just wanted to understand. so we already have some clients here or is it still a, it’s still very early stages?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,"No, so we have set-up a global delivery center for them, and. And it is a multi year engagement. I would look at it anywhere from 5-to-10 year sort of roadmap that is the roadmap that we have at this point in time. The color I would like to say is, especially with Japanese customers [Indecipherable], the first a couple of years of engagements are very-very critical. So we have been engaged with them for a few quarters right now before we got into this — before we were empaneled as a global partner for them, right, in some sense. The challenge for them, if you look at it is, outside of Japan, they had a large presence in China and because of the geopolitical issues and so on that we are seeing, they definitely needed to find a partner in another country to derisk their China presence, and that is where Tata Elxsi came in and since we already had a relationship with them, this really helped us. And of course, we delivered significantly on the existing projects that we are developing for them. So that really gave them the confidence to trust us as they are engineering beyond China. And this could be a significant business for us long-term business that we would continue to grow over the subsequent year.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Vimal Gohil — Alchemy Capital Management. — Analyst,"And sir, just on margins or do you think you will be able to recoup — what you’re effectively highlighting is about half a percentage of impact –incremental impact which is margin of — which is of ESOPs. So how do you plan to sort of offset that going ahead?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,"No, so of course, you know, we have different levers available, including utilization, yes, there will be cost that will be coming in because of wages and salary hikes and so on. So, I think for the year, we are pretty well-positioned to be in, say, a band of I would say from a PBT perspective or I would say between 28% to 29%, so that is a brand that we are targeting to operate in.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Vimal Gohil — Alchemy Capital Management. — Analyst,"Understood, sir. Thank you very much and wishing you all the very best.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,Thank you.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sulabh Govila from Morgan Stanley. Please go-ahead.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Sulabh Govila — Morgan Stanley. — Analyst,"Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. So. I had a couple of questions. So one is with respect to the divergence in growth within the top 10 client bucket and outside of that. So outside of top 10 client buckets, the growth was a bit soft. So just trying to understand what you’re hearing from clients with respect to the spending patterns and whether the growth that you’re expecting in the coming year, it’s going to be broad-based, or you expect the top 10 clients to continue to do well for you?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Sulabh Govila — Morgan Stanley. — Analyst,"The second bit is on the margins. But if you could provide the margin walk for the quarter, as well as if you could talk about where we are on the investments journey that we started, with respect to hiring middle level managers and developing a on-site location in Germany, for example. So where are we in that process and how do we plan coming into next year?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Sure, so. So, I would say, we definitely have been able to mine, especially our large customers pretty well, not just in the quarter, but I think over the over the financial year. I think you’ve done a commendable job in really increasing our wallet share and taking business away from competition. And really growing those accounts, right. And then when you say growing the accounts, as you may realize we — a lot of our business is offshore based, so we have been able to convince customers to move a lot of work offshore and you know –and that has really helped us. So we will definitely continue to grow our top 10 accounts within — in the next financial year and so on. And when I saw top 10, it includes the top 20 customers that we are looking at.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"So — so, I think overall if you look at it in the market, tes, it is a difficult macroeconomic situation. And you know the R&D budgets are all discretionary. So we see some signs of it, there are some customers that continue to invest and grow and you know and trust Tata Elxsi’s delivery capabilities and work with us and so on. But there are a few, the customers that — that have, have had some issues in terms of their our own R&D initiatives, they are either getting paused or put on a hold or for whatever reasons, right. So, so — so beyond the top 20 customers, so we definitely have a set of accounts that we would really want to push into the top 10 and top 20, so we are focused on that and we’re really working on that select set of customers to see how we have we can move them into — gain larger market-share there and move them into a bigger bucket and so on. So that’s something that we continue to do, but at the same time, if you look at the overall set of customers, large wave customers that we have, there could be a few customers that have some issues in their own business and so on. So that is why I think there is a relatively softness in the beyond the 20 bracket, I would say.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"But I think that’s — that happens every quarter and I don’t think it is a cause for concern. So definitely a large part of our growth will be — will be pushed by our top 20 customers. At the same time, there is the next set of customers also that we are carefully curating and really working with — working with very-very clear objectives of moving them from one bucket to another. So that’s something that we continue to do.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"From all the initiatives that we have, hiring managers, mid-level managers and the offices in Germany and other places, right. So, we have, we have also investments in UK, as well as in US and so on. We have over the year, we have — those investments continue, and I think those ramp-ups are happening satisfactorily. In fact, we have been able to deliver value for some other customers, including in Germany and UK, based out of our delivery locations in those respective countries.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"So I think — I think it is still a — still a work-in progress. And we would continue to execute on the strategies that we have laid out and we are as per our plan I don’t think we have a concern there. The SMEs, the mid-level managers and so on, that we continue to both internally ramp-up resources as well as hire laterally, so that efforts continue.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Regarding the margin, Gaurav, can you answer that?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. Hi Sulabh, this is Gaurav, I will take your second question on the margin walk. If you see, for the quarter, our margin on the EBIT front, it was in the narrowly below what we delivered in the last quarter, just 30 basis-points, that is primarily to do with the campus onboarding that we did during the quarter and also what Manoj also alluded to the fact that we continue to make investment into the people, subject matter — subject matter experts and augment our sales team across the location, which is important from a forward-looking strategy and technical capability that we want to continue to build upon. So we continue to invest in that– in those parameters, but that’s why the EBIT margins came 30 basis-points lower compared to the last quarter, but if we see at the PBT level, PBT level our margin was 29% this quarter compared to 28.7% last quarter. So, in fact on the PBT, we have delivered better and stronger growth and the margin this quarter that has to do with the higher other income due to the interest incomes and the R&D credit that we get from some of our onsite businesses and the exchange gains that we have made during the quarter. If you see at a PBT level, we have done better than the last quarter. And that is even better than PAT — at the PAT level, we had done 23.3% and PAT is almost at 37.4% on a year-to-year basis if you see on a full-year basis, we have a 37.4% growth in our PAT.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Sulabh Govila — Morgan Stanley. — Analyst,Understood. Thanks for the comprehensive answer and thanks for taking my question.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,Thank you.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Utkarsh Katkoria from PGIM India Mutual Fund. Please go-ahead.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Utkarsh Katkoria — PGIM India Mutual Fund. — Analyst,"Yes, sir. Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. So I just wanted to understand in light of Tata Technologies IPO that is likely to get the market, how do we compete for business say versus a Tata Technologies, which is a part of the same group? And what is our go-to-market strategy and how is that distinct, say from Tata Technologies or some of the other players in the sector?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, so, Tata Technologies is a group company and as you know Tata Technologies is a subsidiary of Tata Motors, right, and they get a significant portion of their business from the group companies TML and JLR, a lot of their business is around, definitely, the mechanical engineering, the PLM, they do a lot of work on the ERP side and of course, in a few verticals. I think automotive, aerospace, industrial, and those are verticals that they operate operator in. Whereas Tata Elxsi is primarily focused on the embedded engineering hardware and software, along with a strong focus on design. So literally speaking, we are orthogonal to orthogonal entities, the service offerings are literally orthogonal. So, so. I think, you know from a Tata Elxsi’s perspective, we really don’t see an impact of Tata Technologies affecting our business. But they have a very-very strong portfolio of services that they deliver to their customers and we are literally a complimentary sort of offerings that they have.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,"Maybe I can just add a little bit. This is Nitin here. Tata Technologies has been in business for many years now. And they have been in the market for many years now. So in that sense, from a competition and the customer perspective, they’re already there, they are already factored in. It’s only for investors that is a new factor, because they now coming up with an IPO, rather than being a subsidiary that is not investable, right, so in that sense, it will — it won’t change the status or world view doesn’t change for us at all.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Utkarsh Katkoria — PGIM India Mutual Fund. — Analyst,"Right, right. So what I understand is that while they have heavy on automotive and we are also heavy on automotive, the kind of service offerings they have are very different from what we are doing?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, half of them, I would say, yes.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Utkarsh Katkoria — PGIM India Mutual Fund. — Analyst,"And when it comes to other segments, we are — have strength in healthcare and communication while they have more strength in aerospace and industrial.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, that’s correct.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Utkarsh Katkoria — PGIM India Mutual Fund. — Analyst,So is there a time when both Tata technologies and Tata Elxsi together have gone to a client to sort of win some part of the business. Is there a combined go-to-market strategy as well or we operate completely in different spaces?,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"No, we are two different companies, so we operate independently. But at the same time, we’ve had occasions where we have come together to deliver a end-to-end service for the customer. So that has also happened. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for that. Thank you so much.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of CA Garvit Goyal from Invest Research, please go-ahead.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
"CA Garvit Goyal — Invest Research, — Analyst","Hello, good evening, sir. Am I audible?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, please go ahead.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
"CA Garvit Goyal — Invest Research, — Analyst",Just one question basically on the margin sustainability side. So do you think these level of margin will become sustainable going-forward for next two-three years?,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"It’s very difficult, difficult to forecast two-three years and so on. But if you look at the next financial year, we strongly believe that we can sustain this level of margins.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
"CA Garvit Goyal — Invest Research, — Analyst","Okay, understood. And what about the growth outlook for next year, next year?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"We are pretty bullish about the growth prospects that we have. Yes, there are still macroeconomic uncertainties and challenges that there in the industry, but I guess we will get-out of it. It’s a question of one quarter or two-quarter time-frame. There are parts of our business that are already showing green shoots and that is what will really focus on and we really hope that we’ll be able to get back to a decent growth path.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
"CA Garvit Goyal — Invest Research, — Analyst","Okay, understood, sir. Thank you.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Astute Investment Management. Please go-ahead.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Ajay Jain — Astute Investment Management. — Analyst,"Hello. Hi. My question is does AI and generative AI, like ChatGPT affect positively or negatively on our profitability and billable values going-forward?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,"Yes, hi, this is Nitin here, Ajay. Maybe I’ll take that question. If you look at it, ChatGPT has the greatest impact on jobs that are automatable easily. So to that extent, a lot of typically what would constitute shared services, creative services and so on, is where we believe the impact is a lot more direct from generative AI. But when it comes to very domain-focused problems, and let me give you an example, when it comes to autonomous cars for example, you have to train cars to be able to drive on roads and deal with scenarios that are completely complex and different. You cannot use a generative AI like ChatGPT to cars to drive on roads. You can, you can ask CHATGPT about what is the best car to buy, but you can’t allow it to run the car that is, that you want to buy. So to that extent, I think the fact that we operate in domains, the problems that we address problems are very deep domain problems, for example, the recommendation engines that go into OTT products, that tells you what you like, what should we watch next and so on. The AI that goes into cars that allows it to drive or the AI and healthcare that looks at radiology results, looks at precise image mapping, identify disease. So we think about it, these are specific problems, these are not generalized problems. So to that extent. We see very little impact from ChatGPT or generative AI directly in our businesses. Ours — there are areas where we are actually starting to use it ourselves, right and there are very interesting applications that we can use it beyond what we do today. So that would be our assessment at this time.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Ajay Jain — Astute Investment Management. — Analyst,Would it be on-balance lead or cost-cutting area or to improve your billable value or reduce your billable value in the future?,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"No, for us, we think we see AI as something that enhances value all-the-time. So even in our own domains and our on projects, we don’t see standalone AI projects, we see AI building into the projects that we deliver. So to that extent, I think ChatGPT is just another lever in the armory.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Ajay Jain — Astute Investment Management. — Analyst,"Yes, I agree, but GP — apart from that, there are so many new AI solutions going to be available soon. So that — I’m asking my question in that context, not limited to ChatGPT.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"I mean, no, sorry. So your question is? If you can repeat the question in that case, please?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Ajay Jain — Astute Investment Management. — Analyst,Will AI affect you positively or negatively?,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"AI is a great positive. It is already a great positive for us. What we’re saying is, it’s alway been a great positive, it will continue to be a great positive and generating AI by itself doesn’t represent a threat.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Ajay Jain — Astute Investment Management. — Analyst,"Okay, thank you very much.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,Sure.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Akshay Ramnani from Axis Capital. Please go-ahead.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Akshay Ramnani — Axis Capital. — Analyst,"Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question is on employee cost. I’m just trying to understand it. It is up about 4.5% on a sequential basis. If I look at last quarter headcount, it was flat. This quarter headcount is also up by about 2.2% and I’m assuming we don’t have a wage hike this quarter, so what explains this increase in employee costs?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,"Hi, Akshay. This is Gurav, let me take that question. The employee cost increase I mentioned earlier is because of one, the headcount increase that we have done, also some of the on-site investment that we have done in the people, sales, subject matter expertise and also remember that while we have a benefit from the revenue side, but for the onsite headcount, there is also a cost impact that comes from the exchange — exchange movement during the quarter compared to the last quarter, plus we have certain new contribution plan that we have started in the US geographies, which — for which also cost got added in this quarter. So those three, four factors added to the cost from as when you compare from the last quarter.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Akshay Ramnani — Axis Capital. — Analyst,"Got that. Got that. And other expenses line-item has been quite volatile over the past three quarters, so any sense on what’s the sustainable basis number there or is it expected to get volatile in the near-term as you see it?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,"So if you see the last three quarters, after quarter four and quarter one or quarter one of this financial year, when the COVID related lockdown started to open, so we had to open back the offices, travel started to resume — started again. So there will be — it slowly started to come back and as people started to come back, we also need to set-up the facilities, then there are certain increase in the discretionary expenses, nut on a quarter-to-quarter, they will always be even, which will be very quarter-specific, which may not have the cost in this quarter versus the last quarter, but most of the cost that was not there during the lockdown period is now back. So probably, if you see quarter-to-quarter, two quarter average, that would be the level of operating, I would say, the other expenses that — where we will operate now.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Akshay Ramnani — Axis Capital. — Analyst,"Sir, you mentioned quarter two, quarter three average, is it?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"I’m saying last two-quarter averages if you see, don’t take one quarter as a benchmark of basis, but take a couple of quarters to take average as what percentage of our overall operation where we will run those other expenses.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Akshay Ramnani — Axis Capital. — Analyst,"Got that. Got that. And my question was to Manoj. Manoj, if you can touch upon the hiring outlook for next year and maybe based on the deal wins which you have in hand, how do you expect the revenue to shape up over the next couple of quarters?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, so from a hiring perspective, in this financial year, we will be adding almost, I would say 2,200 odd headcount. That is the current plan that we have. Out of which almost 1,800 or so would be the fresh grads that we would add. And about 450, 500 gross laterals — I mean net laterals that we will add. So that is the sort of headcount that we are looking.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"From a growth perspective, I think I’ve already answered. We definitely see in each of the businesses that we are, we see a good confidence of the opportunity is coming back. There are large deals that we’re signing, in the process of signing. There are lot of discussions happening with customers. So yes, there is a little bit of the macroeconomic uncertainty, so, I would say, let’s wait for the quarter and see how it how it rolls out. But we are –sitting out there today, we are fairly confident of the way forward.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Akshay Ramnani — Axis Capital. — Analyst,"Got that. Just one if I can squeeze in. So offshore revenue has come off slightly in this quarter, is it just a quarter phenomenon or is there anything any diversion we are seeing there?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,"I think it not significant, it’s very marginal, that kind of movement between onsite and offshore, depending upon the project completion in a quarter will always be there, but if you see that range of movement quarter-to-quarter, that is very insignificant.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Akshay Ramnani — Axis Capital. — Analyst,Got that. Thank you.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Urmil Shah from Ageas Federal Life Insurance. Please go-ahead. Urmil Shah, the line for you guys been unmuted, you may proceed with your question.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Urmil Shah — Ageas Federal Life Insurance. — Analyst,"Yes, thanks. Good evening, gentlemen, thanks for taking my question. My question is a follow-on the transportation business. Sir, just to understand, you mentioned that a few [indecipherable] that happened in case of select clients, was it towards the back of the quarter or it was more that one project got completed and the ramp-up was the follow-up time. Secondly, as regards to [indecipherable] performance, the US has been relatively softer in this quarter, was it to do more with the auto business or it was broadly across the vertical. And lastly, as regards the top five clients in the auto segment, how has the performance been, specifically, for the transportation segment among the large clients?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,"Yes, maybe I can take that on behalf of Manoj, this is Nitin here. With respect to auto and the revenue ramp-up over the last quarter, it’s a combination of factors. So to some extent, like Manoj said, there are projects that have ended and the renewals and extensions have taken a little time in some cases. In some cases, it’s about — I mean including Alps Alpine and so on, you’ll find that the whole announcement was made on May 20, sorry, March 23rd, almost the last week of the quarter, right, because the inauguration done on that time and we have started to build-up an entire center starting from then. So we would have ideally liked to have had that announcement made in the first week of Jan and then got to building the business and ramping-up revenues right from there. So to that extent, I think nothing to worry, simply it’s a combination of factors, but the path ahead is clear, right.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,"Moving to your second point in terms of US, for us, US as far as almost secular. In fact, Europe is typically auto dominated while US is a lot more media and healthcare. So to that extent, that more or less explains the softness, if at all. And was there anything else that you had, Urmil?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Urmil Shah — Ageas Federal Life Insurance. — Analyst,"The top clients are from transport verticals, right?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,I think they are doing extraordinarily well.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, we don’t see an issue there in the top-five customers there.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Urmil Shah — Ageas Federal Life Insurance. — Analyst,"Sure, and sir, just on [Indecipherable], which quarter should see a ramp-up of he deal?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"It will happen over this — this financial year, right, from Q1 to Q4, so. So it, it is not going to be step-change right from one, it will be a gradual ramp-up that will happen.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Urmil Shah — Ageas Federal Life Insurance. — Analyst,"Sure, so safe to assume that —",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,"Sir, sorry to interrupt. Can I ask you to please rejoin the queue for further question?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Urmil Shah — Ageas Federal Life Insurance. — Analyst,"Sure, thank you.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ajay Garg, an individual investor. Please go ahead. Ajay, the line for you, has been unmuted. You may proceed with your question.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Ajay Garg — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Yes, so I believe all the questions have already been answered, there are no questions from our end.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tushar Bohra from MK Ventures. Please go-ahead.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Tushar Bohra — MK Ventures. — Analyst,"Yes, thanks for the opportunity. Sir, first, I would like to understand some of the initiatives beyond your top three segments, automotive, media and healthcare. You have been ramping-up on initiatives in defense, aerospace, maybe a few other industries or segments, if you could give more qualitative comments, inputs around that.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Tushar Bohra — MK Ventures. — Analyst,"And in a related question, we’re seeing a revival of manufacturing, domestically, lot of interesting opportunities coming up E&S, semiconductor space and so on, does Tata Elxsi have play in any of these areas? Defense offset for example, defense-related stuff in India? If there are anything interesting things you would like to highlight?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Tushar Bohra — MK Ventures. — Analyst,"And lastly. I want to understand on the IP front, if there are any notable wins or any interesting qualitative comments on your IP side?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Sure, so maybe on the IP front, I would ask Nitin to respond. Yes, apart from the three main verticals that we have, we’ve really been focusing on our design business. And within the design business, really focusing on, of course, consumer electronics, manufacturing is an area that we have been investing in and you rightly said, in India we, we see a lot of opportunities in the manufacturing space, especially with our industry [Indecipherable] and IoT solutions that we have. So-so yes, so we are building that muscle. And we have some interesting deals that they have won over the last financial year, right. So that’s something that — and I think that progress is satisfactory way I would say,",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"We are really not working from a defense perspective, but we really work with organizations like ISRO or VSSC. So I’m happy to let you know that we have been involved in the Gaganyaan project and we’ve done some very fantastic work there, and whenever — I’m not sure whether they already published on our website and so on. Okay, at an appropriate time, we will — we will definitely talk about that. It’s a cutting-edge work that we have done and we are very proud of the type of work that we’ve done for ISRO.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, on the IP front, is there anything that we want to specifically talk about?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,"Yes. Tushar, to that extent, there is nothing new to report in terms of our portfolio, we are building some and we have some very interesting IP that we are investing in, especially that leverages AI significantly, whether it is to be able to do predictive maintenance and prognostic relating to automotive or otherwise, relating to battery technologies and being able to predict state of charge and advanced algorithms that Power EV experiences. We are investing in ad tech, especially the recommendation engines and related content moderation and so on because we see a lot of opportunities around how do you manage and automate the management of content that’s being published on social media or streaming video and so on. So in that sense, is very selective and very careful investments that we’re making.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,"To develop some more and augment our existing platform and products with AI-based capabilities. There are some wins and there are some interesting in fact. I would say very good traction that we’re seeing, especially with our IoT platforms, connected car platform. We are seeing some good traction with TEPlay, which is our white label OTT platform, especially in emerging markets. I’m hoping that we can make some of these announcement and we’ll actually see that also reflecting a little non linearly and our revenues in the quarter to come.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Tushar Bohra — MK Ventures. — Analyst,"Thanks guys. Just follow-up on the question. By when do you think a, your non top three segment performance would be reasonably large-enough to report as separate segments. And on the design side work that we’re doing in these new areas, you mentioned manufacturing, industrials and so on, does it translate to work on the embedded side and longer-term commitments or does it remain at a design level engagement, get-in, get-out quickly?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"That is the that is the change that we have brought over the last, you know, four to six quarters, right, where we strongly we have been pushing design. design as entry strategy, but definitely, our focus is to look at the downstream activities, including software, hardware development and end-to-end product maintenance and the lifecycle of the product, right. So, so that’s how we have been — and then what we have also done is to strongly integrate the design capabilities in our sales team, right, so that the sales team that goes ahead talks from a design perspective, so. I think that has actually also helped us mine our existing customers and also opened new logos for us and so that is a very strategic move that we that we have done and you know, definitely in the quarters to come. That’s something that will help more both topline and bottom-line for the company.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rajesh from Zenith Financial Services, please go-ahead.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Rajesh — Zenith Financial Services — Analyst,"Yes, good evening, thanks for the opportunity. I just wanted to check like, do we have the capabilities or do we have any plans to work on something like a geospatial technologies, because somebody mentioned about the aerospace and defense sectors?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"No-no, we — currently, we are not focusing on that?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Rajesh — Zenith Financial Services — Analyst,And we don’t have any plans in time to come?,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"No, because it’s a very-very — very-very niche area that we really are not — at this point in time, we’re not even thinking about it.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Rajesh — Zenith Financial Services — Analyst,"Okay, and apart from the three segments you just mentioned that you are also working on some other manufacturing and other segments. So how how soon or how when can we see appreciable reporting of revenues from the other segments?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yeah, so whenever we reach — we reach a size that we believe we can — we can report and we can sustain — we can sustain that particularly thing, right, that is when we will — we will talk about it, we don’t want to pressure ourself by giving you a number or a time-frame today and then — So we will take it whenever we are confident we’ll come out.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Rajesh — Zenith Financial Services — Analyst,"Somebody is taking a long-term, say three to five years, so when can we see that change happen?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Definitely, in that timeframe, you will be able to see.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Rajesh — Zenith Financial Services — Analyst,Perfect. Thank you so much and all the best.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sanjay Satpathy from Ampersand Capital Investment Advisors. Please go-ahead.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Sanjay Satpathy — Ampersand Capital Investment Advisors. — Analyst,"Yes sir, thanks a lot for the opportunity. You mentioned that you are fairly confident of the transport vertical growth, which should be something similar to that 25% kind of growth that you’ve seen in recent years. But at the same time, there was a slowdown in Q4. So just what — you have tried to explain it, but just want to understand that when will we start seeing that actualization in that vertical in the revenue?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"You will definitely start seeing that as we close the deals and there are definitely large deals at this point in time that we are bidding. And we have been shortlisted and so on. So it’s a question of when the paperwork is done and when we’ll be able to get into a billing situation and so on, so. What we were expecting some of the deals to close, maybe early part of Q4 and some of those have got deferred. So I think we are in active pursuits in many opportunities, I would say, the funnel is pretty strong. But yes, there have been some delays due to the market situations and so on, so. So I’m really not that concerned about it and we will definitely recover moving forward.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,"So, Sanjay. I think simply put, we should pick-up speed.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Sanjay Satpathy — Ampersand Capital Investment Advisors. — Analyst,"Understood, sir. And considering that your media, you have already managed to get lot of orders, so basically, FY ’24 could be a year that will be more balanced towards, is that what you will say?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,"That’s what we’re hoping for. Especially, we want all the engines to start firing right. Yeah, we’ve had some weaknesses in the last financial year in a few of our verticals and we’ve over the last few quarters, we’ve been working hard to really put in steps to really get back to a growth path, and I hope we will see that — those results in subsequent quarters.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Sanjay Satpathy — Ampersand Capital Investment Advisors. — Analyst,Thanks a lot.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Karan Uppal from PhillipCapital India. Please go-ahead.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Karan Uppal — PhillipCapital India. — Analyst,"Yes, thanks for the opportunity. Firstly, on transport vertical. So on the SBB related deals, any sense of the reasons of the deal size, because one of your competitor has announced two deals which are in the range of $150 million to $250 million. So anything which you can give a sense on?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Karan Uppal — PhillipCapital India. — Analyst,"And secondly, you have spoken about transport and broadcast, that of healthcare, any outlook which you can provide for FY ’24?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, so on the deal sizes, yes, the deals that we have also closed are multi-million dollar deals, so — so, definitely, yes, the opportunity exists and you — if you look at it, we bring very-very strong domain capabilities in this area, especially on cloud and DevOps and IoT and and so on, right. And this entire what do you say, software-defined capabilities that we’ve built over for many quarters, right. So, I think we are pretty confident on the deals that we have picked-up, right at the right margin levels for us, so. I think that’s something that we will be very-very careful and I have — and again, most of the deals that we have picked-up are offshore-led, right, which means we’re not really looking at the on-site-led business. most of us are offshore-led. Yes, it will take a little while to show in terms of revenue growth and so on, but I think we are in a very-very good wicket, and very good path to take the growth forward.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,"Right. And Karan, I think your second question was on healthcare and the fact that we are not built inventory. I think I would simply put it this way. If you look at it, it’s been on a great path and suddenly in a quarter, you had a setback of, one part of the business just vanishing or other rather diluting because of the regulatory deadlines change. So essentially, something that was supposed to be delivered in four quarters was now allowed to be delivered over 16 quarters, which means that the [indecipherable] doesn’t change, but our entire business is now going to be spread over 16 quarters. I think the healthcare business has done extraordinarily well in my opinion, not only to recover, but also to find different customers, different work within existing customers and has nothing to do regulatory that allows you to recover. So for me, I think the great plus point, 1%plus return back to growth quarter-on-quarter from the previous quarter, which essentially sets the pace for new customer additions and new business.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Gaurav Bajaj — Chief Financial Officer,"So in that sense, we are very-very both happy as well as bullish on healthcare. Maybe while a quarter more of speed that needs to pick up, the long-term —",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"It’s a long-term lead business, it takes lead time to really convert, so, I think we are working very hard on that.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Karan Uppal — PhillipCapital India. — Analyst,"So sir, just to understand, you’re saying that healthcare might grow lower than the company average, while transport may grow higher than the company average? Based on whatever comments you have made, this is what I can conclude or maybe you can correct me?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"We’re not — we’re not making those statements, you are putting words into out mouth. Okay, sir. Thanks and all the best for FY ’24. Thank you. Thank you, Karan.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Urmil Shah from Ageas Federal Life Insurance. Please go-ahead.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Urmil Shah — Ageas Federal Life Insurance. — Analyst,"Yes, thanks for the follow-up. Just on the supply-side, Manoj sir, you had mentioned that at least on the auto front, previous quarters had there been they been more billable headcount, growth could have been better, so going into FY ’24 is the supply-side easing and it could be also a lever for margin? And part of your question is —",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"You know, as it is, your voice is also breaking and you — so supply-side, yes, definitely, I would say, supply side is easing out a little bit, as compared to maybe a couple of quarters, I think we are in a better position. We have actually built-up bench strength, right, which is significant. And we have been investing in people over the last, I would say three to four quarters and we would have seen, even from a headcount perspective, we have been we have been investing. So I believe we have a healthy bench available today and will be able to use that bench to really deliver the growth that we are planning, so.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, I think from a supply-side, the three critical resources we still. I mean, SMEs and so on. We still have, we could do the definitely if you had more of those, we’ll be very happy. But having said that, we in a better situation as compared to a couple of quarters ago.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Karan Uppal — PhillipCapital India. — Analyst,"Sure, sir. Sir and as regards the [Indecipherable] for this year, we should be following the normal cycle?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, yes.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Urmil Shah — Ageas Federal Life Insurance. — Analyst,All right. Thank you. Thank you and all the best.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Manoj Raghavan — Managing Director and CEO,Thank you.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you, everyone. Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Vimal Gohil from Alchemy Capital Management Private Limited. Please go-ahead.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Vimal Gohil — Alchemy Capital Management. — Analyst,"Thanks. Thanks, again. Gentlemen, just one, one question on media and comms, around 5G, if you could just maybe highlight, are you seeing this demand from 5G coming in from existing customers because I think some of your — a couple of your top-five customers are [Indecipherable] into this vertical or are you seeing some of the newer customers embracing newer solutions around 5G? And what sort of work are we exactly doing, sir?",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,"Hi Vimal, this is Nitin here. Maybe I’ll take that. The two deals that we announced are actually two new customers for us. So, you will find that in the deals that we announced, you will find that the Middle-East telecom operator who is the deployed 5G and is now looking at monetization opportunities both B2B as well as B2C. And for us, that’s a fantastic intersection, because we’re saying look, that opportunities are going to be with what can you do with logistics, connected cars, connected fleet, what can you do with connected and digital health, what can you do with media? So for us, we are coming in as on top of 5G. And what ties the industries that we are in and applications there from a monetization perspective. So that’s the telecom opportunity, where we are on the side of the operator and looking at how to make money from 5G. The other deal, if you look at it that we announced was whether absolutely world-leading technology company to build — a telecom product company to build products that would go into the consumer homes for broadband and fixed wireless access, it’s 5G on the — in talking to the world and it will possibly be WiFi and so on, in talking to the home. So for us, these are completely new deals, completely cutting-edge work and we believe this can be replicated very-very well across both, new customers as well as existing customers. So to that extent, there are conversations going on, there is some amount of work going on on existing customers. I think these deals represent great opportunities to replicate.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Urmil Shah — Ageas Federal Life Insurance. — Analyst,"Understood, thanks. Thanks again. Thank you.",TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd 
Mr. Nitin Pai — Chief Marketing and Chief Strategy Officer,Thank you.,TATAELXSI,Tata Elxsi Ltd

Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, as a quarter, it was better than the previous quarter and of course better than the one before that as well. There are a few reasons for this. We had some improvement compared to the previous quarter of course, because we had no shutdown this time. We had a shutdown in Roha during the previous quarter, which affected the operations and there was also a significant slowdown in the markets because of destocking. That destocking reached according to us close to the bottom and then consumption started again in this quarter — in the Jan to March quarter, not back to the expected level, but certainly better than the previous.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"The other thing is there was no significant movement in the raw material prices like we had in the July to September quarter. So, we had more stability, we had better availability of raw materials and also improved logistics. In one way that’s also an indication of global slowdown because earlier containerships — space on vessels were not at all available and now it’s freely available. While we are happy that logistics costs have come down, and they’ve come down to almost the pre-COVID levels, it’s an indication that things are not all rosy in international markets.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, we had a top line of INR94 crores for the quarter and EBITDA of INR17 crores, which is about 18% is not a bad margin. However, it was also a case where there were some rebound from very low stocks at the customer end and yet the prices are coming down. We are seeing — so, although you will look at the top line as less than the top line of the same quarter in the previous year, the volumes are substantially better this time, but because of low pricing of raw materials and finished products, that’s not apparent in the top line itself. Profit before tax of about INR9 crores at about 10%, that’s a reasonably good number considering the circumstances.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"And I’d like to say a few things about the macro scenario. I’m sure you must have heard from other companies as well that the markets are not very encouraging at this time. The Chinese are back in the production phase, but they are not back in consumption and consequently, they are dumping their products not only in India but in other markets as well. So, there is certainly pricing pressure not only for DMCC but for all Indian companies and all European and American companies as well. So, that is one fact.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"The other fact is that the crisis in Ukraine continues and it looks like it’s going to drag on almost indefinitely, with neither side giving up much. So, uncertainty in Europe also contributes to lower consumption and more uncertainty means less optimism means less consumption. As you can all see from the sales of cars and electronics and things like this, all the discretionary spending has come down. So, our end user industries, some of them are also not doing too well like people are not buying that many shirts as they used to. So, therefore, textiles, therefore dying and intermediate for dye, people are not buying cars, therefore polymers and plastics as well as pigments are affected to that extent. This is seen and we are not too far away from those end use segments. So, we can also see that impact.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"But, happy to report that our main — all our capital expenditure, the large part of it for the foreseeable future has been done successfully. We have achieved the production levels and efficiencies that we wanted in the plants and as and when the market turns for the speciality chemicals, we will surely be there to supply. In this quarter, we had about a 40-60 split between the bulk and speciality chemicals segments. And as we go forward, we expect it to go up to 30-70 or so, again depending on prices.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Overall, that’s what I’d like to start with and I’m happy to answer questions that I’m sure you will have. Thank you, Abhishek.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Questions and Answers:,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,"Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Saurabh Jain from Astute Investment. Please go ahead.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Yeah, good morning, sir. Yes, I’m happy to see that there is recovery in the sales and also just wanted to congratulate you on very good sales in exports considering the environment.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Saurabh.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Yes. So I wanted to understand that from what I see that we’ve grown in exports at 61% for the year FY23 versus over FY22. So, what is the volume growth in this?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, difficult to give you volume growth, but at least this much in terms of volume, probably a little more than that, because the prices are surely lower than the previous year.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Okay, so, you’re saying at least 60%?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Yes.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Okay. And any sense on how FY24, FY25 is looking specifically on the exports front in terms of volume growth also that you might be able to achieve?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, difficult to predict and I don’t like to give forward-looking statements. This call is mainly to discuss last quarter and last year, but I’ve presented the macro headwinds and I think we are all subject to that. So, I think any prediction at this time would be not correct.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Sure. But going forward, do you see that the exports business will grow faster than domestic obviously, in spite of the headwinds which you’re having?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, as I’ve said before in a lot of calls, we do show the export earnings and local earnings separately, but honestly, I don’t differentiate too much and I’ll tell you why again. Because a lot of our customers are taking our product doing one or two steps and then supplying overseas. So, if the overseas market is down, then there’s a global downtrend, then our customers in India also will get affected, and it’s not that India can work in isolation. While we do import a lot of the bulk chemicals, we are not a bad exporter of the downstream speciality products, and in the speciality products in fact, India is close to a net exporter, while in the bulk chemicals and other areas, petrochemicals, etc., we are a massive net importer.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, the growth of our sales, whether domestic or international, will obviously be linked to the overall markets and no company and no country can really work in isolation. So, we are watching what’s happening in China. They are literally dumping and obviously there’s nothing much anyone can do about it if they choose to sell below cost. While companies are looking at alternatives to China, companies in Japan, companies in the U.S., everywhere, what they are willing to pay as a premium is not very clear, and it hasn’t happened yet.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So since you asked this question, let me take a step back and also talk about a little bit which I missed in the opening, that we made significant investments in sustainability and we continue to do so. We have one more project which we complete this year, which will reduce our carbon footprint again substantially. And there’s an EU carbon tax, which is going to be there for companies which have a high carbon footprint.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, apart from looking at the markets and looking at the processes, products, everything, we are looking at the sustainability side, and as and when there’s a value to low carbon footprints and environmental commitment, we will be right there at the forefront and I believe our footprint would be amongst the lowest in the industry, and surely within our peers and surely compared to anybody in China. So, that’s not happened yet in terms of generating value but as and when — and it’s certain that it will. It’s just a question of when it happens, we’ll be there.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, sorry, back to you if I need to clarify anything else, Saurabh?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"No, no, that’s great to hear. And sir, just on the top three products, would you be able to give us the volume growth in that and the — other than the top three products volume growth on the speciality side?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, I don’t distinguish. I would like to give individual products, but there was growth across the board, let me put it that way.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Okay, okay. There is —",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"For existing products as well as new products. I know you’re asking about our mature products as well, but they grew as well, if that’s the answer you’re looking for.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"But the new — in new products also, I mean, you are seeing growth and traction, besides the top three products?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Not as much as we would like, simply because when there is a downtrend, people don’t have time or money to invest in new product approvals as they would in normal times. And when prices are going down anyway, like the Chinese are dropping prices, the people are first looking at the bottom line rather than anything else. Now again because of easy logistics, that whole supply chain risk, all the purchasing managers have forgotten. So, let there be some kind of a consolidation phase. Where there’s an uptick in the market, I think there will be much more traction for new products.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Great. But if I understand what you’re saying is that, it’s taking longer to have your customers switch from their existing suppliers to you for the newer products?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,And vice versa.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,Okay.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,We won’t get knocked out easily either.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Great. Going forward if we can get some sense on volume also, since the prices of the products are actually so volatile, it would be great to get some sense of the volume also if you’re able to disclose that?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, I can tell you that the volume is substantially more, although I would not like to get into total volumes or anything. Anyway, that’s irrelevant, because one year ago we just had started our sulfuric acid plant. That’s 100,000 tons of Dahej. So, those volumes would warp anything. And you have to look at it from that point of view. So, we don’t disclose individual product volumes. We’ll continue not to do that.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,Sure. But on an aggregate basis also if you would be able to give that that would be helpful if.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,It is more. Let me put it this way that there is a growth in overall volumes as well.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Okay, thank you and all the very best. I’ll come back.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our next question from the line of Shivakumara Swamy [Phonetic] an individual investor. Please go ahead.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,Hello?,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,"Mr. Swamy, yes. Please go ahead with your question.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,Am I audible?,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,Yes..,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,It’s not very clear. Can you come closer to the mic or something?,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,Hello. Is it audible?,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Yes.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,"Sir, regarding that being a speciality chemical segment, we are facing some pricing issue from Chinese when the Chinese are opening up. Are these molecules in that speciality chemicals or commodity chemicals?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, most of that Chinese in fact would be in the speciality chemicals because in our bulk products, there is a different competition but not necessarily from Chinese and most of our bulk chemicals are sold close to the factory.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,"No sir, because as you told it, we are facing that competition in speciality chemicals segment itself. In my opinion, speciality chemicals means it’s the high margin, low volume product, so Chinese dumping has started. It means your manufacturing is a speciality chemicals or it’s related to commodity chemicals?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So even in the speciality chemicals, there is competition. We are not alone, as you know, we are not monopoly producers. And yes, there is higher margin than in bulk. But that doesn’t mean that Chinese cannot compete in that.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay, sir. And my second question is regarding you’re investing in technologies like continuous flow chemistry, biocatalysis regarding that one. Are these technologies related to only pharmaceuticals or it can be applied to our chemical processes also?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, we’re very much applied to our products as well. In fact, we have been doing flow chemistry since a long time. One of our — one of the advantages we have is that all our processes, even for some of our speciality chemicals are continuing. Therefore, we are amongst the lowest cost producers in the world for those products. Yes, pharmaceutical industry is working on flow chemistry. But it’s not that it is restricted to pharma industry only. In fact, according to me personally, I believe that for the hazardous chemicals and particularly for upstream, it is more important to go to flow chemistry than the pharma industry, because we are handling larger volumes, more dangerous chemicals, we would benefit much more from movement towards flow chemistry. So, I personally recommend this and we are personally practicing this as well.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay, that’s helpful and that’s all from my side.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Ankit Gupta from Bamboo Capital. Please go ahead.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. Sir —",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Ankit, could you speak a bit louder, please?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Sure, sir. Is it better now?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Slightly.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, Sir, if you can talk about, now since the prices of our products have dropped, so at optimal capacity utilization of the new plant, how much revenue on a consolidated basis we can do when we reach let’s say optimal capacity utilization?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, again, the prices are dynamic. So, on what basis you want me to project? So, if I would have looked at Q4 ’22 numbers of INR104 crores, if the same prices were prevalent today, we would have done at least 30%, 40% or 50% more than that. So, on what basis, should we take it? Because when —",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"That’s for March ’23 prices. Let’s assume current last quarter’s prices of around let’s say we did INR95 crores of top line. So, let’s say, if the current prices sustain, how much revenue can or both the facilities generate?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, the current prices are also reflected in the low raw material prices, I just want to clarify that as well, it’s not only the finished products prices. And i believe we could do — what happens is we run the sulfuric acid plant at both locations in any case at 90% and upwards capacity. So, there’s limited headroom on the sulfuric acid side. But on the downstream products, we do have some upside, I would say at least — again this is an estimate, but at least 30% to 40% extra we can do on the downstream side after our recent expansions at Dahej.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"So, let’s say, we have ended of around INR100 crores per quarter, let’s say for downstream products, when we ramp up at optimal capacity utilization, we can touch INR130 crores, INR140 crores kind of quarterly run rate?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Something like that, yes.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Sure, sure. And sir, let’s say, since the prices of the raw materials have also come down, do you expect some margins to go up now since the realizations have fallen for us, do you think that margins can be better than our historical levels going forward?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, first of all, future projections are impossible to make and I don’t like them. But what happens is mathematically if your margin remains the same in absolute terms, but your prices come down for both raw materials and finished products, then as a percentage it increases, you may see a better margin at lower prices and then a lower margin at higher prices, but not necessarily in absolute terms.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay. And sir, on the boron side, we have been facing challenges. Do they still continue or we’re seeing some improvement in the boron side?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, certainly some availability improvement on the raw materials side, also the logistics side. So, earlier we were not getting the raw materials on time, etc., now that situation has eased and we expect to have a slightly better run rate on the boron business in coming times.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,And that will also really lead to improvement in margins there?,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Certainly, if we do more volumes, we’ll have better margins — overall margins, absolute margins. But again, we don’t want to predict going forward absolute numbers or anything like that.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,"But we should see some improvement compared to last two, three years that we have been facing challenges on that front?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, certainly has been improvement especially in this last quarter on supply availability.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital — Analyst,Thank you and wish you all the best. Thank you.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] We have our next question from the line of Saurabh Jain from Astute Investment. Please go ahead.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Yeah, just a follow up question. I wanted to understand what kind of capex should we pencil in for us for FY24, FY25 broadly as we see now?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, not a significant number, nothing compared to the last two years that’s all I can say.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Okay, okay. And depending on obviously how the environment is, do you have a certain timeframe in mind as to when you might think of the next level of maybe expansion?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, with so much uncertainty right now, we are not looking at any major large investments. If you had a look at the cash flow, we’ve started paying down some of the loans. And I think with the high interest rates and everything, that is more prudent thing to do. I think we will wait till we generate some more operating cash flow and also wait for the interest rates to come down a little bit before we get aggressive again.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Saurabh Jain — Astute Investment — Analyst,"Right, right. Yeah, I must congratulate you on the net working capital is well in control and you managed it quite well.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Yogesh Tiwari from Arihant Capital Markets. Please go ahead.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Thank you, sir for taking my question. Am I audible?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Yes.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Sir, just on the boron chemistry, so just wanted to know that does boron have alternate application to lithium and can it be used in the electric vehicles and become like a major driver for our company?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, that’s a little bit of an R&D question, but I can answer you — I’m not an expert on the EV side, but more than electric vehicles and more than the lithium, they are looking at hydrogen pure — the hydrogen storage using some boron compounds. So, when it comes to alternatives to this lithium batteries, lithium has its own problems, environmental issues, plus dependence on a very few countries. So, when — on a bigger scale, you’re looking at alternative to electric vehicles when you are talking about fuel cells or something like that, then hydrogen is required. And because it cannot be piped easily or transported easily, you have to look at some source of solid form of hydrogen and that’s where there is R&D work being done on some boron compounds, which can store hydrogen, but not directly in EVs as far as I know.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Sure, sir. So just to understand, from where do we actually import like the raw material for boron chemistry like from Europe or through a trading partner in Asia?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, there are few sources of boron in the world, so the U.S., South America, Turkey and also China. And we would look at importing from the most economical source and most reliable source. That’s all I can say about where we source from.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"And sir has the raw material prices for boron actually like increased significantly in the last year, like there were some news around it?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, the prices have increased, but at least the availability is better.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"And sir, lastly on boron chemistry, like when do we expect we can — or what level — volume level do we expect turnaround in the boron division?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, we would need to make some investments to have a significant increase in the boron business and we are not ready to make those investments yet.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Okay, sure. Thank you, sir. That’s all from my side. Thanks.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Nikhil Upadhyay from Securities Investment Management. Please go ahead.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Nikhil Upadhyay — Securities Investment Management — Analyst,"Yeah, hi. I joined the call a bit late, so sorry if this question has been answered already. But on the demand side, like last two quarters, you sounded pretty cautious on the demand side both for the new products on the speciality side for which we had done the capex. So, how are you looking at the overall scenario now?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So still — while — what happened particularly in the October, December quarter is lot of large end users, they were destocking, they saw prices coming down, there’s no visibility on sales, so they just stopped buying or reduced it substantially, so there’s no further reduction now as far as we can see, but it hasn’t picked up significantly as yet. So, it’s a very sort of soft market scenario at the moment across industry. There are a few exceptions, but in general, there is not enough consumer demand and there is excess production from China as I’ve already mentioned. So, that sort of making the overall market looking quite difficult.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Nikhil Upadhyay — Securities Investment Management — Analyst,"Okay. And for the products for which we had some demand visibility from the customers, even there, the pricing has gone significantly down or even the demand is remaining weak, so is it a combination of both which is impacting or –?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, the pricing is more a reflection of reduction in the raw material prices also, but the volume demand is — volume drop is significant in an overall sense. Since we did an expansion, we’ve seen an increase in the total sales, but that’s because we tapped some extra business, so we had already some pipeline which we managed to fill, but there is certainly — the whole optimism is not there, which we would expect. And I don’t think it will come back until this whole year.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"There are two major issues happening; one is the crisis in Europe and the second is the interest rate cycle. So, hopefully interest rate cycle has peaked and with easing of interest rates in the future or at least flattening first and then easing, there should be some consumer sentiment improvement. And once the consumer starts buying, then there will be demand from the industrial side as well.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Nikhil Upadhyay — Securities Investment Management — Analyst,"Okay. And last question. So, on the capex which we had done, would it be breaking even as of now at the production level or is the utilization not enough to meet the cost — the fixed cost?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, we are slowly breaking even. But we’ve not made the investment just to break even. We are expecting a much better upside which we haven’t seen.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Nikhil Upadhyay — Securities Investment Management — Analyst,"And we would be operating at 20%, 25% kind of utilization or more than that?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, as I mentioned earlier on the bulk chemicals, we are above 90% in any case, we have to operate those plants. But on the speciality chemicals, it’s lower and we don’t have exact percentage utilization, but I’ll say that there is a room for growth.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Nikhil Upadhyay — Securities Investment Management — Analyst,"Sure, sir. I’ll come back in the queue. Thanks.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Shivakumara Swamy, an individual investor. Please go ahead.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,"Hello, am I audible?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Yes.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,"Sir, thanks for the follow-up. Sir 4egarding the speciality chemicals segment, that number of processes involved in the manufacturing of pet [Phonetic] chemicals means from raw material to [Indecipherable] how many processes are involved in that, sir?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, there’s changes from product to product. And difficult to give you a general answer to that question, but it’s multi-step — typically multi-step processes.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,"In general, multi-steps means it’s two, three or four, in general if you —",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"There’s no general answer to that. It could be two, three or more.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Shivakumara Swamy — Private Investor — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Okay. Thank you, sir.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Yogesh Tiwari from Arihant Capital Markets. Please go ahead.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Thank you, sir for the follow-up. What I understand is like last year somewhere in between the prices of sulfur-based compounds, it has declined for about INR35,000 to about INR10,000. So, just wanted to understand like what would be the prices now and what would be the scenario as of now?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, you can look up any of the publications for the current price of sulfur. I don’t have it on hand and may not be the right forum to discuss here as well. But it is substantially lower than what it was at the peak, and it is stable at the moment. But it’s a pure commodity and there are a lot of dynamics which can affect the upward and downward movement. So if I could predict the movement of sulfur in the future, I would rather play on that than do anything else. So, difficult to visualize, but at the moment it looks stable.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Sir, just to understand the worst case scenario like what would be an estimate for the industry cost of production wherein that would be like a bottom for sulfur prices so if an approximate number for what would be like an average cost of production for industry for sulfur-based?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Sorry I didn’t get the question.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"So, just to understand like what would be the worst case scenario, if sulfur prices fall further, so like what would be the cost of production — the industry cost of production if somebody is producing sulfur?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So it’s a well-known phenomena that — I mean, well-known fact that roughly 0.33 tons or 0.34 tons of sulfur is required per ton of sulfuric acid. That is for everybody. And if the price of sulfur goes down, the price of sulfuric acid also likely to go down, although it’s not necessarily true because it’s not a fixed formula. The market dynamics of sulfuric acid and market dynamics of sulfur are completely independent and quite unrelated.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Okay, sir. But just to understand what would be an average cost of production if somebody is producing maybe now a ton of sulfuric acid? So what would be the average cost of production for it [Indecipherable]?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"I just told you what is the sulfur ratio. So, it would depend on the price of sulphur at that time.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Okay, sure. And, sir, next question. Hello? Yeah, hello?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Yes.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Yeah. And sir one question is on the exports front. So, are you seeing any uptick in demand from Europe regarding sulphone-based products in different months?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"There is right now no uptick in demand from Europe for anything. I think there are too many internal issues and until they tackle those, I don’t see them becoming optimistic on the markets.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Okay, sir. Thank you very much for it. Thanks.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Sajal Kapoor [Phonetic] an individual investor. Please go ahead.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Sajal Kapoor — Private Investor — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. And, hi Bimalji, we as an organization have been visiting CPHI events quite regularly. And anything you can share from the recent CPHI event in Japan?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So in general, Japan and India are moving closer together politically as well as business wise economically. There is an — you can read in the paper almost every day there is some investment into India from Japan. So, the Japanese economy is not growing, they are threatened by the Chinese politically and they are looking for alternate partners. So — also, their style of working although is very different from Indian style of working. So, there’s a cultural gap which we need to sort out. But I think Japan and India will come closer together in every way, because even at the top political level, there is a meeting of the minds. You can see lot of infrastructure projects in India are funded by the Japanese. They have a lot of money, they have a high consumption, but they have low growth and they are looking where else they can invest so that they can participate in the growth of other countries. So, India is certainly one of the top sort of friendly countries with Japan.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Sajal Kapoor — Private Investor — Analyst,"RIght. That’s helpful. As Japanese culture is very different in related to that, their requirements are also very different, they’re very stringent in terms of compliance requirements, do we have what it takes to sign longer-term contracts with Japanese customers or will it be more like on a spot sale basis for Japan and also for the Indian customers, is it like we do longer-term contracts, supply agreements with these pharmaceuticals companies both in Japan and India or is it mostly spot sale basis?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, we have been supplying to Japan for many years now and I don’t think there’s a problem in meeting the requirement. Of course, you have to be consistent, of course, you still have to be competitive. They still look at Chinese prices, even though they don’t want to deal with China. But they still do deal with China. In fact the biggest partner is still China by far. But most of our speciality business is not on spot basis, whether it is a written contract or unwritten agreement understanding it doesn’t matter, but we don’t have to go looking every month for new customers and all that. So, it’s quite stable from that point of view.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Sajal Kapoor — Private Investor — Analyst,"Right, right. And finally, what are those one or two things that you would like to change in DMCC going ahead and why do you think those changes are important?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"It’s difficult to answer strategy-related thing. Of course, I’d like to see bigger top line, bigger bottom line, that’s for sure and we are working towards it, and also we are looking at — we have placed a lot of emphasis on sustainability. So, I’d like to see us improve on that front as well. Although, I would say we are one of the front runners, but still I’m not satisfied. So, these are the areas where we would look at in the future.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Sajal Kapoor — Private Investor — Analyst,"And as we grow bigger, I mean, do you think that we need greater investments in R&D and innovation and does that mean hiring more qualified scientists and more people or is it something on the capital investment side that we have to undertake if we want to get on to the next level of science and innovation, supporting these global innovators?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Of course, capex as well as people, you can’t do anything without people and R&D surely will play a big role.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Sajal Kapoor — Private Investor — Analyst,Any specific targets that you have for this year or next year to beef up the R&D?,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"We are recruiting, we are strengthening our team, but we don’t have a particular target in mind for R&D spend. Typically, we are doing about 1% to 2% of our top line as R&D spend and we will continue like that for a while.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Sajal Kapoor — Private Investor — Analyst,Do we get any sort of advances from these Japanese or other customers to undertake specific synthesis projects on their behalf?,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Sorry, I didn’t get the question.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Sajal Kapoor — Private Investor — Analyst,"Do we — so, sometimes these innovators when they ask specific custom synthesis project and I’ve seen this with the pharmaceutical API players in India, the customers are more than happy to give advances for procuring raw materials and initial R&D work. Have you experienced any such transaction where a customer is willing to give us advances for a specific custom synthesis project requirements of theirs?",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"So, we’ve done small cases of this kind of thing, but not in any significant manner.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Sajal Kapoor — Private Investor — Analyst,That’s helpful. Thank you for all the responses and all the very best.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. As there are no further questions, I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Bimal Goculdas for closing comments. Over to you, sir.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited 
Bimal Lalitsingh Goculdas — Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you. So, thank you all for attending. I hope it’s been worth your time and it’s good to get these questions, it’s always good to hear from the investors side what your views are, what your concerns are, and of course we will adjust ourselves accordingly. But look forward to interacting with you all in the future as well and thanks for your support.",HESTERBIO,Hester Biosciences Limited

Operator,I now hand the conference over to Ms. Reena Shah from Elara Securities. Thank you and over to you.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd

Reena Shah — Elara Securities — Analyst,"I would now like to hand over the call to Mr. Bhavin Shah for opening remarks. Thank you and over to you, sir.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Reena. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to welcome you all to our earnings conference call to discuss Q4 ’23 financials.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd

Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,"With that, I would like to hand over the floor to our CMD, Mr. Naresh Patel, for his opening statement. Over to you sir.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Thank you, Bhavin. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you all are doing well. A warm welcome to our Q4 FY ’23 earning call — conference call.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Before we jump to our update on our performance, I would like to take a couple of minutes to reflect on how FY ’23 has fared for us. It is no secret that the year began on a very challenging note with the ongoing war in Ukraine severely affecting supply chain, impacting commodity and gas prices, increase in raw material prices, among other. All these factors have added to significant cost pressure for all the companies. While supply side issues continue to pile up, we also saw muted demand environment across industries. While the start of the year was demanding, the situation has gradually improved as the year progressed, albeit at slower pace.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Moving to the current scenario. On the industrial front, things are on the mend [Phonetic]. Specifically on pharmaceutical segment, cost pressures have rationalized to great extent. An important update closer to home is that the Chinese chemical industry is back with a strong production and competitive price, which has started hurting many industries and players. I believe we will see more of it in coming quarters. While these factors play out in the industry, at AMI Organics, our business model is designed in such a way that the revival of the Chinese chemical industry has minimum to no bearing on us. To put into perspective, we never benefited from the shutting of plants in China with the COVID or supply chain issues. And second most important thing is that we remain a global market leader in our key products with China and other geographies in the second and third spot. So Chinese industry coming back strongly did not affect us.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"On the demand side, we are witnessing gradual upswing in demand in half year of FY ’23. And I believe the revival will continue in H1 FY ’24. At AMI Organics, we have used this challenging year to create various growth drivers for the coming year. We’ll discuss these growth drivers one-by-one. I will start with Electrolyte Additives. I’m happy to inform you, as of today, we have received approval from six customers worldwide. We have also received plant scale trial commercial orders of few metric tons and we are also expecting bigger commercial orders during the current quarter. We believe the volume will be — will ramp up slowly as we progress through the year.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Looking at progress on the Electrolyte Additives segment, we have started working on the plans of expanding our capacity for this product. I will provide update on the same once our plans are finalized. One more important update on this one is that we have developed two more products in this segment. One of them is liquid electrolyte additive to increase the electrocapacity of the lithium-ion batteries and one more additive for solid-state battery. The products have been approved at the plant scale and are in advanced stage of validation.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Moving on to the second growth driver, we started working on initiatives to get into long-term contracts with customers, which improves our future revenue visibility. We have successfully signed some long-term LOI and contracts with some of our big customers on this front. The Fermion deal was one of the same line of talk. I am delighted to share that we have been able to expand the scope of our contract with Fermion and we have added a couple of high-value intermediates for the same. This means we will now be doing three advanced intermediates for the same which increase the value of our contract manifold.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"The third growth driver for us would be new products. During the year, we have developed several niche Specialty Chemicals products which are at different stage of validation and approvals as we speak. Some of these products are very big when you look at our current size of business, and I will update you on these product as they reach certain milestones.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Last but not least, we announced the acquisition of 55% stake in Baba Fine Chemicals last month. At AMI Organics, our inorganic growth strategy is based on two elements: one, where we are either interested in buying the asset, which we can then use to expand our products; or the other, where we are able to gain access to new products and technology, which is difficult to create organically in short term. The acquisition of Baba Fine Chemicals falls under the second strategy, where we are gaining entry into a very-high entry barrier semiconductor industry. They have been in this industry since inception and they’re looking for an opportune partner who share their business ethic and chemistry capabilities. I’m happy and proud that they chose AMI Organics. On the financial side, they have strong balance sheet with zero debt. Overall, the acquisition fits perfectly in our strategy and chemistry capability. Overall, our organic pharmaceutical business will continue to grow strongly. And now we have some good growth lever lined up, which will boost the overall growth of the company.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Moving on to our Q4 and yearly results. Starting with Q4 FY ’23, we delivered highest-ever quarterly number in Q4 at INR186 crore. This translates into close to 30% growth on year-on-year basis. Growth was by driven by Advance Pharmaceutical Intermediates business. On the full year number, we continued our strong momentum in FY ’23 achieving total revenue of over INR621 crore, which was higher than 19% when compared to last year. Our pharmaceutical business aided the growth for the year with 22% growth year-on-year, whereas Specialty Chemicals business grew slightly by 3%.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Our operating margin for the year were flat due to cost pressure, which I discussed during the start of my speech, which impacted our margin in H1. However, our margins rebounded strongly in H2, and we ended Q4 on 21.9% operating margin. I will let Bhavin discuss financial in details.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"To conclude, I believe the challenging days are behind us and I am confident that we will continue the strong growth momentum in FY ’24 as well.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"With that, I request our CFO, Mr. Bhavin Shah to discuss the financial with you. Over to you, Bhavin.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Naresh Bhai. Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to briefly touch upon the key performance highlights for the quarter and year ended 31st March 2023. And then we will open the floor for question-and-answers.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd

The gross profit for the quarter was at INR81.3 crore, up 28.3% as compared to INR63.4 crore in Q4 ’22. The gross margin for the quarter was at 43.6%. Lower gross margin was due to high cost inventory which has been completely consumed by Q4 FY ’23.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd

The PAT margin for the quarter were at 14.6% as compared to 14.8% in Q4 FY ’22 and flat as compared to Q3 FY ’23.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd

This was driven by advance pharma intermediate business, which grew strongly by 22% on Y-o-Y basis.

EBITDA margin for the year remained flat at 19.9% as compared to 20.2% in FY 2022.

PAT for the year was at INR83 crore, up 15.8% on Y-o-Y basis. PAT margin for the year was at 13.5%. Export for the year was at 59%, whereas domestic business was at 41%.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd

During the year, we have generated strong cash flow from operation of INR65 crore, which was driven by better working capital management. I believe we will continue to generate robust cash flow from operation in coming year as well. This will support our routine opex as well as capex.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,"With this, I conclude my remarks and request the moderator to open the floor for a question-and-answer session. Thank you.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,Questions and Answers:,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Chirag Lodaya from Valuequest. Please go ahead.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Chirag Lodaya — Valuequest Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Yeah, congratulations on good set of numbers. I have couple of questions. First on segmental margins, if you can help us understand what were the full year margins in Specialty Chemicals and Advance Intermediates division.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,"So Chirag, full year margin for pharma business is 21.57% and specialty at 10.3%.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Chirag Lodaya — Valuequest Investment Advisors — Analyst,Okay. And how are we seeing margins going ahead segment-wise?,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,"As we are guiding that our first target is to at least do our FY ’21 margin for pharma business, which we have already achieved in Q4, that is 23%. So we are — we would like to maintain this margin and would like to go further from here. As far as our specialty business is concerned, we have improved 100 basis point in last quarter and in coming quarters, we’ll see 50 to 100 basis point improvement quarter-on-quarter basis.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Chirag Lodaya — Valuequest Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Right. And if you can throw more color on Specialty Chemicals division, what kind of ramp-up we are seeing next year. And you have also talked about few new products which are under pipeline and which will help to scale up the business, so some color on Specialty Chemicals, what to expect and what will drive the growth there.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"So I’ll take that. This is Naresh Patel. Specialty is our more focus area currently in AMI Organics. And we are — have a robust plan for growth in Specialty Chemicals and also phase out the old products of Gujarat Organics. And in that line, we have developed around 20 molecules in Specialty Chemicals segment in Gujarat Organics and some are already LOI signed and started qualification at the end of the customer. And these are all versatile application including electronic [Indecipherable], polymer industry as well as some paint industry, additive, [Indecipherable] as well as some electronic industry. So cumulatively, it will be bringing a lot of large volume and large value. We are targeting this year the Specialty Chemicals segment will grow around 25% to 30% against our normal growth of 20% to 25% of — 22% to 25% of our pharma industry.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Chirag Lodaya — Valuequest Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Right. And coming to this new acquisition, which is undergoing, of Baba Fine Chem, if you can just help us understand what is the overall opportunity size for this company, because current revenue is quite small, it is a niche business, it looks like. So some color there, what kind of scale we can create maybe three, four years down the line.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Thanks. That’s a very right and very vast question you had asked this, because, currently, the size of the company is small, because it is running by the three scientists, R&Ds, they all are market scientists in the semiconductor industry having holdings, several patents in their name. And now, out of the two, one is already — got passed away in COVID and one is aged out, so he wants to exit and that opportunity we got to get the major stake in the Baba Fine Chem. Baba Fine Chem has a main application in photoresistors chemical in the semiconductor industry and they are making very high pure chemical passed for the Indian kind of PPT, normally we talk in PPM. But this is [Indecipherable] purity. So that is a very unique technology and capability of Baba Fine Chem, and upward going — while market is more than $2 billion in photoresistor chemicals. And so there’s a huge potential available. So by AMI Organics introducing a [Indecipherable], we can able to give them the operational leverages that will help them to grow the business.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Chirag Lodaya — Valuequest Investment Advisors — Analyst,"But any ballpark number, what to expect over, say, three, four years?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,It will be — definitely it will grow more than 3 to 4 times in upcoming years.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Chirag Lodaya — Valuequest Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Okay, that is helpful. And lastly, bookkeeping question, what would be the capex for FY ’24?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Currently the capex for FY ’24 is just the capex which is ongoing and whereas once these electrolyte orders are start flooding, we will do some capex — plan some extra refill [Phonetic] capex for that and that capex will be in second half of FY ’24. We will announce it when — value of the capex once we are ready for that.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Chirag Lodaya — Valuequest Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Ex of electrolyte, the overall number would be?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,"Ex electrolyte, we are having a INR35 crore of maintenance capex and there will be additional capex for solar we are planning so that when we’ll announce that, so there will be a additional capex for that also. And we — so this is the capex plan for the year.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Chirag Lodaya — Valuequest Investment Advisors — Analyst,"And greenfield facility will have around INR160 crore, INR170 crore balance capex?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, greenfield capacity will have around INR160 crore, INR170 crore capex spending to be done in the year.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Chirag Lodaya — Valuequest Investment Advisors — Analyst,"So put together, INR200-crore-plus next year, right?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,Yes.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Chirag Lodaya — Valuequest Investment Advisors — Analyst,"Okay, thank you and all the best.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Mitul Mehta from Lucky Investment Managers. Please go ahead.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Mitul Mehta — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"Good afternoon, sir. Congratulations on a very good pharma operating numbers. Sir, from the day we acquired Gujarat Organics till today, our numbers have not been up to the expectations. So can you help us to understand what sort of product portfolio are you building there? Are we — you think you can scale up the pharma business — I’m sorry, the Specialty Chemicals business in next two, three years? The current investment that we did when we acquired Gujarat Organics and working capital, the current ROCE looks very, very sub-optimal. So just wanted to get some color on that. My second question is on the Fermion contract. If you can help us to understand when does the delivery commence for Fermion and can we get some more color on this contract? I mean, this is going to be over, let’s say, 10 years or even further on? So can you help us to understand would be the questions.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Your number one question is where does Specialty Chemicals portfolio relate to Gujarat Organics. Let me tell you one thing, we acquired Gujarat Organics in April 2021. Since then, two to three years has just passed for the takeover and taking the management and all. Then we — three months we worked on what are the areas we need to be focused and we made a robust plan for that. And that is how we shifted all the manufacturing site from Ankleshwar to Jhagadia and we made the free land for our pharma expansion and that is without losing any single order. But the last year was mainly for the consolidation in terms of the product sustainability, technology upgradation. We had done a technology upgradation for methyl salicylate, we had done technology upgradation for parabens as well as we had done four or five new molecules which are commercialized in FY ’24 which are in the application in UV ray absorbents, and application in agro chemicals as well as in application in petrochemical industries. So these are the molecules we developed and started commercial orders in FY ’24.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"So our target is to far sustain the business without losing the money and volume and then make sure that now this business will be replaced as well as grow with a new product and the margin and operating margin from 0% to bring to 10% and that we sustained for last eight quarters and now we are increasing. Last quarter, we increased by 100 basis point and now we are targeting to increase and bring it to 18% to 19% of margin in Specialty Chemicals in this year. So this is what we are doing in Specialty Chemicals segment. And revenue size will be up to 0.5 [Phonetic] times in next two to three years, which is our targeting. This is just a projection. It is just [Phonetic] for plan.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"And in terms of Fermion contract, that is a long-term contract and it will be start supplying from Q3 of FY ’24. And that will be somewhere around — I can’t say the value because it’s a very big value and it will be mature — the full capacity supply will be starting FY ’25, because it is a pharma and it takes some time to register in 180 countries worldwide. So in FY Q3 and Q4, it will be giving us a sizable revenue. But from FY ’25, it will be giving us a full revenue. So this is how we are targeting Fermion. And in that contract only we had three more products in that, and that all three products is additional to the contract, so that will also help us to grow more numbers in the upcoming years.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Mitul Mehta — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"The three products that you mentioned are other than the product that we have with Fermion, right?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"So basically, we are doing the supply of a very well advanced intermediate in that three raw materials, which we are supposed to import from China, but that we made in-house, and now we’re consuming in-house. So that is an additional advantage for us to have not only the top line increase, but also the revenue and profitability also can be increased in that.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Mitul Mehta — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"So if I — I was just looking at some of the primary data releasing by their — on their presentation, it’s public information. So their current run-rate is about EUR180 million for the new [Indecipherable]. And so, if I annualize, that comes to roughly about EUR800 million. Currently, our supply is, let’s say, to begin in Q3 and will scale up in FY ’25. So at present, is it possible for you to reveal from whom they’re currently sourcing the intermediate?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"If you’ve done such a good research then — this product is growing at unexpectedly 300 times a year. So it will be — their expectation was whatever they expected in 2026, they already crossed in 2023, so it’s growing very fast and the basic API manufacturing plant in Fermion is fully utilized and the intermediate which they are trying to source from us, they are currently making in-house, they don’t have another source other that than us. So that this how they are increasing their capacity and we are going to make their intermediate in AMI Organics and the final API. So the growth rate of this product is so high, they want to move faster and all the capacity and all the technology, everything is available with us. So that is adding advantage to them.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Mitul Mehta — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"Is there a technology barrier in this particular product? Can they develop an alternative supplier? I mean, is there any alternative supplier who has…",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"They don’t have currently any alternate supply, and this is a CDMO kind of work where we do the development and the manufacturing of the product. So it’s all in the CDMO, CRMO, CDMO segment of AMI Organics.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Mitul Mehta — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, your thought on apixaban, I mean the anticoagulant family that we are currently supplying, how is the growth rate there? And do you also foresee that this particular segment can be a very big growth driver for us in the next two to three years?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Yes, definitely our anticoagulant is always a key basket for AMI Organics, and that is the reason why we have developed all the anticoagulant basket which is currently launched or going to be launched, which include apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, all kind of — which have expiry year to 2035, we have full basket is ready. Apixaban and rivaroxaban is a growth driver for us for the next two years because it’s going to be launched and our generic player worldwide, more than 26 customer in apixaban. They are all ready to launch and also they won some litigation in the U.K. against the originator [Phonetic], so that will all cause to start business very faster. In rivaroxaban, now they have qualified us and they started putting order in Q4 to us — Q4 FY ’23. So now we are supplying to [Technical Issues]. So it’s a very good growth driver for us for anticoagulant segment.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Mitul Mehta — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,"And sir, as far as edoxaban is concerned, seems to be a very competitive [Phonetic] product, it’s a new generation anticoagulant, which currently is selling very well in Japan. So are we going to play a significant role there also?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,We have already three customer in Japan who had qualified us.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Mitul Mehta — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,So Daiichi has already qualified us?,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Daiichi not, because they are making all the chemicals themselves there. But rest of the all generic player had qualified us.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,"Mr. Mehta, I request you to come back in the queue, sir.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Mitul Mehta — Lucky Investment Managers — Analyst,Thank you very much.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our next question from the line of Sudarshan Padmanabhan from JM Financial PMS. Please go ahead.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Sudarshan Padmanabhan — JM Financial PMS — Analyst,"Yes, thank you for taking my questions and congrats on great set of numbers. So my question is also taking forward from the previous participant, when I’m looking at the next 18 months, we have multiple triggers: one the Fermion contract; then we have a new generation anticoagulant drug that is going to drive growth; and the three — third one would be the [Indecipherable] side, which can actually become fairly big products for us. In the context of the fact that we are operating the facility at around 75% on the pharma side and volumes obviously will drive operating leverage, I mean, do you think that this 20% to 25% kind of a growth that you have given on pharma and the 30% guidance, I mean, could basically be a little bit more on the conservative side? And could you also talk a little bit more beyond FY ’24 because some of these contracts are going to be more visible in FY ’25? So what is the upcoming [Phonetic] trend in terms of top line and margin that one can realistically expect?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Many thanks and very logical questions you had asked. So normally AMI Organics is always proactive in terms of product pipeline as well as the capability and productivity. So our Ankleshwar facility — upcoming facility which will be ready December ’24 for operational, so that will come with a very huge volume — 4 times volume than our Unit 1 in Surat. So that will be definitely help us to next FY ’24, FY ’25, FY ’26 growth of the pharma and also not only that, to make derisk ourselves if there is any delay in that, we had already started shifting our several chemistries like chlorination, nitration, diazotization, and esterification. Currently, we are making in a flow at a very high volume. So that has free our capacity also in Unit 1 as well. So that is how we can have a buffer of at least one, one and half quarters for us to sustain our growth rate in pharmaceutical in intermediates segment.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"In Specialty Chemicals, we have Unit 3, which is in Jhagadia. It’s running currently at 35% to 40% capacity and it has a capability to handle up to 80% in next two years. Not only that, in Unit 3 also, we have shifted Ankleshwar unit blocks there, which will helping us another 15% capacity, which is currently under installation — finishing of the installation. So that will also add another 15% capacity in specialty segment. So ongoing FY ’25, ’26, we have several contracts, which are in line, few are in [Technical Issues], few are in petrochemicals area, which are LOI already signed but we are not declaring the LOI because it’s — once we include it in the PLIs [Phonetic] and start converting into MoU, then we will disclose about the growth plan and value of these LOI in FY ’24 and ’25.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Sudarshan Padmanabhan — JM Financial PMS — Analyst,"On the margin side, sir? Because we are talking about 150 bps or so that even if you are not assuming that these contracts [Indecipherable] margin, the operating leverage itself should take care of the 100, 150 bps. So are we looking for a surprise on this side?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"We are conservative in terms of our comments and that’s why we are saying that 100, 150 basis point, whereas once these all high-value contracts will be in place, the margin definitely go up in that sense as well.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Sudarshan Padmanabhan — JM Financial PMS — Analyst,"And it will basically be 150 bps again for FY ’25 because will see again a volume growth as well as better margin. It should be — you would see margin expansion again and almost strong top line in FY ’25 as well over FY ’24. So we are looking at multiple here, not just one.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,"So margin expansion is a continuous process. So as we grow, our revenue will grow, system process will be more mature. So currently we are at — running at 23% and we are looking at sustained margin improvement quarter-on — it is premature to speak anything about ’25 currently.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Sudarshan Padmanabhan — JM Financial PMS — Analyst,"Sir, just a small bookkeeping question, one on the current quarter gross margin. I mean there we see some kind of a deficit because of high-cost inventory or there’s a mix, but on a longer-term, the positive side is, we’ve seen a great reduction on the working capital. I mean, we have been able to release about INR40 crores to INR45 crores of cash on the inventory side. So can you talk a little bit more about the kind of work you’ve done on the working capital? And should this improvement continue and what’s our target in terms of working capital days?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Bhavin Shah — Chief Financial Officer,"So, currently, on a average basis, on a — considering sales as a base, our working capital cycle is 108 days. And I’ll try to bring this at 100 days. So we are continuously working on it. We have improved our inventory days. We are trying to get more credit from the — our supplier. And our endeavor will be to reduce our receivable days by another 10 days.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Sudarshan Padmanabhan — JM Financial PMS — Analyst,Sure. And on the near-term…,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,"Mr. Padmanabhan sir, I request you to come back in the queue sir. There are other participants waiting.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Sudarshan Padmanabhan — JM Financial PMS — Analyst,"Sure, sure, thank you.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Rikin Shah from Omkara Capital. Please go ahead.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Rikin Shah — Omkara Capital — Analyst,"Hi, am I audible?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,"Yes, sir.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Rikin Shah — Omkara Capital — Analyst,"All right. So just expanding on to what’s discussed earlier. So in darolutamide, Nubeqa, which is the FDIF [Phonetic], in FY ’21, we saw EUR220 million sales. For FY ’22, it’s EUR466 million and now we have already reached EUR180 million target and Bayer’s aspiration is around EUR3 billion in two years or three years. So considering that materializes, that could — could that result in an intermediate market which was — perhaps [Phonetic] INR500 crores, INR600 crores?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Your calculation — based on the calculation, it may be, I’m not claiming these things because I’m not supposed to. But whatever you calculate, I hope it will be okay for you.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Rikin Shah — Omkara Capital — Analyst,"All right. And in this, you mentioned there is no other suppliers so would we be the ones taking majority of the business?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"It will be 100% with us. We and Fermion, only two guys will manufacture this intermediate.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Rikin Shah — Omkara Capital — Analyst,"All right, all right. And in terms of our anticoagulants portfolio, we are seeing genericization of apixaban in many geographies and many API players in India are also commenting for better growth on that end. So how the entire portfolio be managed? Because in India, perhaps the treatment is at rivaroxaban level. Right? And there could be a shift in treatment as well. So globally and in India, per se, how would our coagulant portfolio be shaping up going forward?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Basically for us, anticoagulant segment is completely a bundle of the product and this is the reason why we filed patent for both the product in apixaban and rivaroxaban, and we are holding process patent for both the intermediates. And we have a sizable customers also worldwide and all geography and these all are ready for launching. Some has already started launching products and all, so that for — it is immaterial for us whether rivaroxaban goes in the market or apixaban goes. For us, it’s like — it’s a bundle and we have capability to produce — in all the products we are doing up to N minus 1. So we have a huge advantage of selling the product in a large volume.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Rikin Shah — Omkara Capital — Analyst,"All right. And on the edoxaban and you touched upon a few things. So Daiichi is selling I think JPY97 billion worth of Lixiana. Right? So considering the generic market of edoxaban in Japan, how big of an opportunity can the intermediate side be worth?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Same as last time, I have to be say that it is — see, basically anticoagulant is a lifestyle disease and that is like an anti cardiovascular disease, similar kind of this and day-by-day the people having a lot of problem of this, which we saw from a very early — during our inception, so that’s why we put our portfolio in the segment. So we are ready with all N minus 1 in that as well. And we have a very good number of customers worldwide. And these are all big pharmas including Teva and there large manufacturers worldwide, they all are our customers who have qualified us as their raw material supplier. So we are also expecting the revenue coming in upcoming years from this side.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Rikin Shah — Omkara Capital — Analyst,"All right. Then sir, last one from my end. On the electrolyte end, we have mentioned developing two new molecules. So you had mentioned in the earlier con-calls that we had vinylene and [Indecipherable]. So would it be possible to give some more color here about what’s in the pipeline?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"These two molecule we bought from the customer and it is under NDA, CDA agreement, accessory [Phonetic] manufacturing kind of thing. And these are molecules that’s used to — for high voltage batteries and for increasing the electrocapacity of the battery — lithium battery as well as one is for the solid-state battery. So this is what we have developed and. Both the molecules are outside China and they are qualified and now we are in process of larger-scale manufacturing compliances with them.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Tarun Shetty from Haitong Securities. Please go ahead.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Tarun Shetty — Haitong Securities — Analyst,"Hi, am I audible?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,Yes.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Tarun Shetty — Haitong Securities — Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on the good set of numbers. Sir, on the Baba acquisition, I just wanted one clarification, 45% of your PAT would be booked under minority interest, is that understanding correct?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Yeah, the 45% is one of the minority third partner which is the key partner of the Baba Fine Chem will be remain as a partner.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Tarun Shetty — Haitong Securities — Analyst,"Okay. In one of your recent interviews you did claim to — even on this call, you just said that the revenue would grow around three to four-fold in the near-term. Could you give any rationale on this? Because I believe the Baba currently has only one customer that it is servicing. Does they have any exclusivity contract there or any kind of restriction on sales, anything that you can give color on?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Yeah, the product which Baba Fine Chem is currently manufacturing and delivering to one customer is exclusively for them, but there are more than 40 products, which is already developed and commercial — on sample, that can be go to the world, apart from U.S., other segment like Japan, Korea and other countries. So there we started promoting this product in that country also.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Tarun Shetty — Haitong Securities — Analyst,"Okay, okay. So basically your trajectory of four-fold growth on top line of Baba still stand.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,Yes.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Tarun Shetty — Haitong Securities — Analyst,"Okay. And just on the margins, I believe currently it is 60%-plus and you did give recently again in the same interview that margins would be around 40%. Anything — any reason for this?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"See, when we — see, margin is a part of when the number and volume will grow also there is a — and then when you go from one layer to another segment of that, there will be some change in the margin side because of some operational and other compliances and other — not compliances, I think so, but other involvement, product capacity involvement and all that will increase the energy consumption and everything. So that will — so we are conservative in terms of 10% reduction in the margin, but definitely it is not like that, but which is conservative is better than bullish.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Tarun Shetty — Haitong Securities — Analyst,Okay. Just one final from my side. Can you give us an understanding of vinyl carbonate’s pricing right now? I believe it was trading around $14-odd or below — is it increased or decreased?,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,Which one?,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Tarun Shetty — Haitong Securities — Analyst,Vinyl ethylene.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Vinyl carbonate is now almost at $10, $11. And chlorovinyl [Phonetic] carbonate is at $12. But we have a process where we can — in this also we can do good margin.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Tarun Shetty — Haitong Securities — Analyst,"Okay. [Indecipherable] answering my questions, then I’ll come back later. Thank you.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Dhaval from Girik Capital. Please go ahead.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Dhaval Shah — Girik Capital — Analyst,"Hello, Naresh Bhai. I have only one question on the electrolyte additives. So over next what timeframe should we assume some revenue to start coming for us?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"We will be expecting by H1 FY ’24, revenue will be start. So maybe in this quarter or latest by next quarter the invoicing [Phonetic] we will start to the customer. We already have some orders in our hand. But we are expecting some big orders from some customers, so we want to plan, clubbing the production together.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Dhaval Shah — Girik Capital — Analyst,Okay. And how will this revenue — what will be the size of revenue over two years period look like?,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Revenue guideline is — I can say, it’s a very huge number, more than $2 billion, $3 billion industry where we are not expecting [Indecipherable]. The advantage for AMI Organics, or say, for Indian manufacturer is that the USA and other European countries has stopped buying any battery cells or anything which is generating from China. So that is then the added advantage is that any manufacturer basing out of China need to have a raw material from outside China. So that is helping us to boost ourselves in a faster mode of getting the orders and all.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Dhaval Shah — Girik Capital — Analyst,"Okay, fine. And sir, just little bit more understanding on the electrolyte additives. So there is this electrolyte salts and then there is additives and then there is electrolyte formulation. So as we’re aware, there are many companies who are working on this product chain. So we are only into additives and the salt or also is the backward integration, we are going to make it or we’ll buy it from outside? Just help me understand this.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"See, normally AMI Organics never go for the competition to the customer, either it is in formulations, in API or in Specialty Chemicals and these electrolytes also we make the additives, which is one of the component of the formulation of electrolyte. And so we will be remain making additives or other chemicals which are used in the formulation. Salts are active part, which is manufactured by few of the companies playing in India as well as several companies in the world who are making the salts, but these all things are used to make the formulation.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Dhaval Shah — Girik Capital — Analyst,"Okay, so that salt, so you will be selling it to other electrolytes — the formulation makers, the additives.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Yeah, the formulation maker is buying salts and additives and solvents and then they make the formulation. So we — AMI Organics is focusing only on additives segment.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Dhaval Shah — Girik Capital — Analyst,"Okay, so over a three period…",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,"Mr. Dhaval, I request you to come back in the queue, sir.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Dhaval Shah — Girik Capital — Analyst,Sure.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Amar Mourya from AlfAccurate Advisors. Please go ahead.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Amar Mourya — AlfAccurate Advisors — Analyst,"Yeah. Thanks a lot for the opportunity. Most of my questions have been answered. Only two, three questions. First, sir, you are guiding for like the profitability improvement in the Specialty Chemicals. Something around 200 basis point margin improvement, let’s say, in the coming year for the specialty part, EBITDA margin?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Yes, definitely it will become 200 basis points. It is more than that, but yes, definitely, 200 basis points is there.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Amar Mourya — AlfAccurate Advisors — Analyst,"Okay, okay and this is led by the flow chemistry which we had done? Is that because of that?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"It’s a mixture of technology, volume and the new products.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Amar Mourya — AlfAccurate Advisors — Analyst,"Got it, got it. And secondly, sir, you are guiding for 25%-plus growth in specialty and 20% to 22% growth in the — basically your core pharma business. Right?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,This is based on the current projections we received from our customers.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Amar Mourya — AlfAccurate Advisors — Analyst,"Okay, okay. And when you say 150 basis point improvement in the margin, that is also in the pharma as well. Right?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,We are targeting to go to FY ’21 and then from then onwards it will be a tough job for us. So that will be our second part of our planning.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Amar Mourya — AlfAccurate Advisors — Analyst,"Got it, got it. And third, sir, this Baba Chemical, I mean, if you see the growth rate, it has grown at a rate of 30% kind of growth. So going back, let’s say, in ’24, again, it will see the similar kind of trajectory?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"Based on the current order in hand, yes, it will be — it look like similar kind of that.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Amar Mourya — AlfAccurate Advisors — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, you talked about that you have a similarity in the chemistry of the Baba Fine Chem versus your existing chemistry. So if you can give us some understanding how it is basically related to your existing chemistry in specialty business.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"I think this is little bit confidential question, I cannot able to answer…",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Amar Mourya — AlfAccurate Advisors — Analyst,"Okay, fine, sir, fine, sir. Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Rohit Nagraj from Centrum Broking. Please go ahead.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Rohit Nagraj — Centrum Broking — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. Just one question. In our presentation on slide number 24 [Phonetic], we have talked about continuous flow reactors. So just wanted to understand, currently how much of our revenues are we generating from the CFR process and are these developed by us or are we buying it from third-party? And incrementally going-forward, after, say, three, four years, what is the [Indecipherable] on our current reactions and capability? What kind of revenue generation can be done from the CFR? Thank you.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"See, basically, we don’t make the dedicated product, flow reactors, we make the chemistry-driven flow reactors. In nitration, diazotization, esterification, these are the flow reactors where we do n number of products. In diazotization we are doing 11 products, in nitration we do nine products, in esterification we do 20 products. So it’s a chemistry-driven flow reactors design, multipurpose flow reactor so which will help us to switch over from one product to another product in a easy manner and we do these kind of — so we — and our single product is containing more than three, four, five reactions. So it is difficult to bifurcate how much revenue is coming from flow reactor. It is important that this flow reactor will help us to improve our operating efficiency as well as the effluent generation minimization and energy consumption minimization. So that is achieved by this flow reactor. In upcoming years, we are going to do the several two or three reactions like [Indecipherable] lithium and [Indecipherable] flow, which is our pipeline right now.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Rohit Nagraj — Centrum Broking — Analyst,"Sure, thank you so much and best of luck, sir.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Aman Vij from Astute Investment Management. Please go ahead.,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Aman Vij — Astute Investment Management — Analyst,"Good evening, sir. My first question is, if you can talk about other basket. How much does anticoagulant contribute to our revenues and, given the strong growth, where can we see this number in the next two, three years?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"See, normally, our product basket is well distributed and none of the basket is more than 15%. So, either it is antipsychotic, anticoagulant or anti-cancer. So it’s a very well wide distributed, so that if any basket will not perform, it will not impact badly on our performance. So currently anticoagulant basket is contributing 12% to the total revenue.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Aman Vij — Astute Investment Management — Analyst,"Okay, and say for next FY ’24 and FY ’25, which basket do you think will be the growth driver in this segment?",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"All are growing in their space and manner, so every — it’s — what can I say that — because all the products are performing well and they are giving us a good drive for — that is the reason we could able to give the guidance of next 2 years.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Aman Vij — Astute Investment Management — Analyst,"Sure, sir. And second question is on the electrolyte segment. So you’ve talked about one product in the normal batteries and one for solid-state. So I thought we are doing two, DEC and FEC. So if you can correct my understanding on that part? As well as in terms of timeline, you’ve talked about you are expecting order this year, but this electrolyte business scaling, will it happen in the second half or do you think it will happen in next year only? And is it initially driven by domestic customers or international customers? If you can talk about that also.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Nareshkumar Ramjibhai Patel — Executive Chairman & Managing Director,"So we have four products now in electrolyte additives, two is DCV and FEC is — two is already matured and now in commercialization stage and two more is developed. One is in liquid and one is in a solid-state battery. So these are the two new ones, so total four products now we have. So I hope this is clarified to you. VCB and FEC, we already have some order in hand. So this year only it will be commercialize and go to the market and the customers are basing in outside India, and in India, there are two manufacturers who have taken a sample from us and they — some has also ordered some few Kgs. But they are still under evolution of themselves. So in India, we don’t have currently more than two customers and for the rest of the world, we have nine customers out there.",AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd 
Aman Vij — Astute Investment Management — Analyst,Are there any non-Chinese customer or is it mostly…,AMIORG,AMI Organics Ltd

"Anand Sethuraman — Head, Investor Relations","With this, I would now request Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy, MD and CEO, to give a brief overview of the company’s financial and business performance for FY 2023.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Thanks, Anand. Good evening, everybody. And thanks a lot for joining the call today. It gives me great pleasure as always to address you all today. It’s been an interesting journey for me since Jan 04, 2023, when I joined as MD and CEO of BSE. As you may recall, in the last quarter call, that I have informed that’s my primary priority is to make BSE a wide[Phonetic] brand exchange. And glad that we entered the FY 2023 having made progress in this regard. The major priority areas driving our roadmap are trading segments of equity, currency derivatives and equity derivatives segment. Some of the changes that we have brought till now are as [indecipherable]. In equities cash segment, BSE has reduced the tick size for strips below 100 to INR0.01 from INR0.05.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"As you know, this is unique for BSE. In currency derivatives, we have introduced another unique feature. New strike price intervals of INR0.10 for USD INR contracts with addition to — in addition to the existing INR0.25 paisa strike prices. In the equity derivatives segment, I’m happy to inform that we are re-launching Sensex and [Indecipherable] derivatives contracts with lower [Indecipherable] and a different expiry. Expiry on Friday, from the traditional Thursday expiry. We believe that these changes will be [Indecipherable] action. This relaunch is happening from May 15, 2023.

We are seeing some positive traction in this regard.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"I also want to update you that BSE has discontinued the liquidity enhancement schemes that were ongoing for equity derivatives and commodity derivatives with effect from April 01, 2023. In addition, BSE has discontinued software services and hardware infrastructure services that were being offered and the technology program with effect from May 1, 2023. At the standalone level, for these schemes and services BSE had incurred a cost of about INR32 crores in FY 2023. The relaunched equity derivatives contract, we feel, will attract volumes and hence we have discontinued the [Indecipherable].",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Let me now start with the financial updates. FY 2023 was a challenging year. As I mentioned earlier, we have however, made good progress on our main priority and setting ourselves up to deliver better results in the days to come. Surpassing all previous year’s performance. I’m happy to inform that BSE delivered a record year again in terms of revenues to reach a total revenue of INR954 crores for FY 2023 as compared to INR864 crores in FY 2022. A growth of 10%.",BSE,BSE Limited

The net profit attributable to shareholders of the company stands at INR221 crores from INR254 crores in the previous year, which is a decline of 13%. The decline is due to the added contribution to the core settlement guarantee fund, we call it as core SGF, to the tune of rupees INR55 crores at a consolidated level, which is an increase of 89% year-on-year. This is on account of added contribution to the currency derivatives and EGR segments.",BSE,BSE Limited

BSE StAR MF, our comprehensive platform, this continues to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another year of record revenues and performance, up 56% year-on year to reach rupee INR78.6 crores. This strong growth is a testament to the strategic broadening of our business model, which gives us the ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environment and BSE’s continued commitment to the equities market and mutual funds in India.

This demonstrates the scalability and reliability of BSE’s platform StAR MF.",BSE,BSE Limited

"Anand Sethuraman — Head, Investor Relations",Questions and Answers:,BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,[Operator instructions],BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, we will wait for a moment while the question queue assembles. The first question is from the line of Prayesh Jain from Motilal Oswal. Please go-ahead.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, good evening, everyone. And first let me congratulate on a great set of numbers. So just a question on the financials. So if I look at the revenue, or the income line-items, there are some like the other security services which has jumped from INR26 crores to INR45 crores on a Q-on-Q basis, other operating income has doubled almost from INR18 crores to INR35 crores, and so as the other income has jumped from INR6 crores to INR12 crores. So can you explain these line items,as to what has caused the jump in these line-items?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Prayesh, just come again one by one?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,Other security services has gone up INR26 crores Q-o-Q.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Okay, then other things? Other operating income going up from INR18 crores to INR35 crores. Okay.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,And other income growing up from INR6 crores to INR12 crores — INR12.5 crores.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"So Prayesh, when — the other security services income comprises from the revenue which we have derived from other group companies, in terms of not only treasury income from clearing and settlement, it is clearing and settlement transaction charge, clearing and settlement charges. And it also includes various — it also include various fees — your admission fees, processing fees and other, all other fees. So this is a –because this year there was an increase in margins in deposits also which we received and the overall clearing activity which has happened. So there is an increase in other security services. Other operating income basically comprises of — other operating income comprises of income which we have received, which is considered with respect to our subsidiary, [Indecipherable] our technology subsidiary, which is the BSE technologies and BSE Institute. So there’s — our technology services from — BSE Technologies has actually had a better year. And it actually earned — its revenue rose significantly during the current-period, current year. And that was the reason why you see a big jump from INR18 crores to INR25 crores there.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"And the other income hike which you are seeing. that is arising mainly out of the income tax refund, which we have received, the interest thereon, which is considered as an income for the current year. And there is a minor reversal of about INR2 crores with respect to certain expenses of earlier year, which has added to about INR600 crores of the overall increase.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay, that’s helpful. So, which other securities services and other operating income run-rate, is it sustainable at this rate or should we think about it indefinitely?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"More or less, it is a forward-looking statement, which you have been asking for, but we are, I think will try to do as much as we can. Just reframing this question, converting into a forward-looking one. Out of the INR35 crores in the other security services and INR35 crores of operating income, is there any one-off items in these line-items? No, there is no one-off item in this front.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay Great. Under other cost, other question was on the expense line-item, so if I look at your employee expense run-rate has been trending down, we are at INR42 crores in this quarter and also say technology costs has come up on a sequential basis, but on a",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,"Y-o-Y basis is still higher. So how, how should we think about these two line-items from a FY ’24 perspective?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Form a FY ’24 perspective again, Prayesh, employee costs, obviously, means, we need to retain talent, we need to hire new talent to come up with — to manage the new initiatives and obviously, there’ll be an upward pressure, which be normal, which can be seen in any other organization. Then there’s technology costs also, while we will do our level best to manage cost to the best of our abilities but there are normal escalations which cannot be avoided year-on-year, and obviously, there are certain improvements which we need to make, upgradations which we need to make year-on year, which will be there as usual. So obviously, that the cost cannot be the same as the previous year in the subsequent year.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay, all right. And just one more thing on the tax side, what is our tax rate for the next year?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Tax rate will be around 35% odd, we have a huge MAT, which is — which is unutilized as on-date. And for that we are investing heavily, whatever we are investing, we are investing in taxable securities. So, we will attract maximum marginal tax-rate for the foreseeable future.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,"Okay, okay and yeah, I’ll come back-in the queue for more questions. Thank you.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Rishabh, an Individual Investor. Please go-ahead. Rishabh, please go-ahead with your question. Your line is in talk mode.Your audio is breaking. We can’t hear you. Mr Rishabh, we request you to please rejoin the question queue.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,I’ll move on to the next question from the line of Amit Chandra from HDFC Securities. Please go-ahead.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Amit Chandra — HDFC Securities. — Analyst,"Yes, hi sir, thanks for the opportunity. Sir, my question is on the steps that we’re taking to revive the market-share and the cash and also the steps we are taking on the currency side. Also we are launching a new derivatives contract, so all these steps obviously, are on the positive direction and we are seeing improvement in our numbers and margins also. But how confident are we in terms of gaining back market-share in the cash segment, which now, with the initiatives that we’re taking?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Amit Chandra — HDFC Securities. — Analyst,"And also, we have spent on the LES schemes over the last many years and we have tried that earlier also, maybe five years back on the derivative side and again, we are again — you’re trying on the derivative side to regain some market-share. As of now we have, I think maybe even market-share there, what’s your thoughts on other BSE segments?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes, thanks for this question, Amit Chandra. My reply maybe slightly sounding philosophical. The efforts, whether we believe it will bring back the market-share, any one effort in itself is not going to bring market-share. We just narrated only a few of the efforts that we are making. Market-share is a function of how much of market participation happens. And there’ll be multiple interventions that would be required from a market perspective for this to effectively happen. This not only make includes making changes, but also making members aware of the requirements and importance and talking to them, and bringing them back and getting attention into the BSE’s platform from the larger public as well. Which is all what we are trying to do at this stage and more-and-more every day, new things emerge for us giving us ideas as to how we can better reach-out to the marketplace.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"So if you ask us, whether we are confident that it will bring back, of course, yes. We have to feel confident about whatever we are doing and we go into the right directions. At some point of time, all the efforts that we’re putting in will fructify and we will gain back whatever we have ceded away in the past, that is the feeling.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"The second question is, well, LES was there, it was discontinued now, lot of effort was made in the past, we are re-launching, what is our view about it? When I think about it, I actually remember a story in the past. I’m not sure you would have heard about this story as well of Robert Bruce. Who launched multiple times war against the King of England and he ran away from one of the battles into a cave, and he was sitting. And he was watching a spider. It was trying to climb up the wall of the cave, it was going on falling down, but the spider never gave up. It tries multiple times, on the seventh or eighth attempt, it succeeded and then climbed up. That was a big news, that was a big inspiration for Robert Bruce. This is an actual story of 1300s, I’m sure if we Google, you’re able to see. Then Robert went back and with rejuvenated energy fought back and he won the battle. The message is try, try, try again once or twice though you may fail, try, try, try again, till you succeed, try again. And we are doing it, with rejuvenated energy, we’re trying changes, which may look really simple, but which may be very material. We have taken market participants into into confidence we have requested them as to what markets impact what changes would bring in. So maybe what did not work-in the past may work and this is the confidence and expectation with which we are proceeding.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,I hope I’ve answered your question?,BSE,BSE Limited 
Amit Chandra — HDFC Securities. — Analyst,"No, sir, it was a very comprehensive answer and I also now expect BSE to do well in these segments. But the second question would be on the cost side. So historically, I know we have spend on several initiatives, which are not yielding results. So are we becoming more cognizant on the spending that we’re doing on these initiatives now, mostly from an ROI perspective and also, I don’t if you can throw some more light on what is happening on the INX side, with — is there some consolidation happening, like one exchange there? And also on our extensive that we’re doing on INX, can you see some [Indecipherable] there, also in terms of expenses there?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Yes. So M&A decision in respect of listed corporates like us, if you look at it — are taken collectively, considering the fact that are available at the point of time, in the best interest of the corporate entity. All the expenditures that would have been made prior to me coming and joining here would have been done, or were done in that same-period, and some of them work, some of them did not work. The enhanced liquidity, Liquidity Enhancement Scheme that was tried. In retrospect and in hindsight when we look at it, probably it has not delivered us much.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"So what is not delivering results should be abandoned and we should try something new, that’s why we are now thinking about product differentiation and product interplay, which is what we should highlight to try to garner volumes, that’s what we’re shortly are trying to do now. When you do that, incidentally what happens there is better a better position in the balance sheet and profit and loss, and there is a better return on investment. It is just not only the return on investment which is driving you to cut-down expenditure, it is also what is effective, what is not effective, what is the cost, what is the benefit, that type of an analysis is what is driving us to take these type of steps. That is one part.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"On the INX part, it’s a very-very-very important question that you have asked. It is very close to our heart, because it’s a national priority, and that we would like to ensure and do anything that is possible, that we, as India, are able to provide a place where all the farmers are able to converge and trade with us, with no export of Indian markets abroad. This noble thought has made us to start the exchange Trust and Clearing Corporation, well-capitalized it and we are running it well, it’s a good amount of market-share as you would have seen, it’s 90%. So this is just starting in my opinion.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,Lot of changes are happening in that space and we are going to be present there in whichever way we can to ensure that the national dream of having a GIFT city in India materializes and BSE is as always a leading part in this noble effort.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Amit Chandra — HDFC Securities. — Analyst,"Okay, thanks for that. And then one last question, so. This is for Nyan, sir, so we have seen the operating cash flows being negative for this year. Can you please explain what has led to this and now?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Nayan Mehta — Chief Financial Officer;,"As you’re aware, that this year was bad for Capital Markets. All exchanges trading volumes went down, not only in India, globally also. And it had a cascading effect on all our revenues were across-the-board. So, since the operating income has a hit, arbitrate also affects operating EBITDA and operating margins. At the other side, you know our Gross Settlement Guarantee Fund, we had to make an additional contribution of INR26 crores over and above our previous year. So, we’ve made INR56 crores of contribution to core Settlement Guarantee Fund in the current year, which was one of the main factors resulting in our operating income actually showing a dip as compared to what you would have expected.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Thank you, Mr Chandra, may we request that you return to the question queue for follow-up questions?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, in order to ensure that the management is able to address questions from all participants in the conference, please limit your questions to two per participant. Should you have a follow-up question, we would request you to rejoin the question queue.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"The next question is from the line of Divesh Agarwal from IIFL Securities, please go-ahead.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Divesh Agarwal — IISL Securities — Analyst,"Good evening, gentlemen and thank you for the opportunity. And many congratulations on a good set of numbers. Firstly, sir, I would like to know this discontinuation of PPD enhancement schemes and the support that you are with ability to. So hybrid solutions. The total shaving to general to come out of deference will be announced. I was going to be pretty facilities. Well just closer crores from the semi industry. We expect you to the continuation of the scheme.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Divesh Agarwal — IISL Securities — Analyst,"Okay and so the way we have discontinued for FY 24, are you having any in terms of start charging on some of the segments where we are not charging. So is there any thought process around that?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Nayan Mehta — Chief Financial Officer;,"So that’s a very good point that you’re making. There are two objectives, always for any entity like ours. One is improving liquidity in-market segments so that we are being at-the-market let’s say very primary objective. That’s our commitment to the market. Commitment to the shareholders making revenue out of it. While both of them run hand-in-hand, the timing, we will have to be very ask to is that both are fulfilled properly. So while we today, have some of the services where we are not getting any revenue, which was given free, we are not in any case. I think any market-share. So that is the place where we are trying to trying to sort of increase our presence and we are trying to get more liquidity there. And once we are able to get some traction, we will of course be charging. So that we serve both the second interest that is not the interest which we need to take care of the shareholders. So it goes hand-in-hand.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Divesh Agarwal — IISL Securities — Analyst,"Understood sir. But more numbers that you can share probably, gets level when or 5% market-share, something like that, but we would look to charge, so that we have some indicators, which we can track.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Nayan Mehta — Chief Financial Officer;,"And that’s a very valid question that you’re asking. I wish I am able to provide you a number. I will, if it is anything which now BSE as an entity can give us an answer, we would have immediately given. It is all purely market-driven, as you would certainly appreciate, you’re from a securities firm, I’m sure you appreciate what I say. So it’s a question of evaluation, right. So we have to see from May 15th, how the equity derivative segment is shaping up. The changes that we brought all from March only, so it is just 1.5 months that has run away. So we need to do more, we need to wait-and-watch, so I will not be able to say at what level of market-share I’ll be able to start charging more in respect of whatever new segments where I am not charging.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Nayan Mehta — Chief Financial Officer;,"In equity options, equity derivatives options already I am charging, it’s a smaller number, it will be revisited soon. In equity futures, I’m not sure equity index, which is they’re not charging anything, once there is some traction, we will charge. Some of the charges we have already started, as you may be knowing, whatever free services were there in respect of colocation, today we are already charging to defray the cost at least to start with, and over a period of time attempt to convert it into a profit center. So it will be busy ships. It will be in the right direction. It will not take too much time, but it will take some time to ascertain.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Divesh Agarwal — IISL Securities — Analyst,"Understood, sir. [Indecipherable] FY ’23 into our profits. Based on the exit run-rate, do you think that there could be further contributions which would be required under SG&A for the time-being we don’t see any significant contributions coming in?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Divesh, contribution to us depends on many-many parameters. One is your total volumes, concentration of positions — concentration of positions open interest, volatility in the contracts, so frankly, it is simply impossible for us to give you a — to judge or project anything about the next year, because we ourselves don’t know.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Thank you, Mr Agarwal, may we request that you return to the question queue for follow-up questions? Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pankaj from Ace Lansdowne Investments. Please go-ahead.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Pankaj Rawal — Ace Lansdowne Investments Services LLP — Analyst,"Thanks for the opportunity and congratulations for the great set of numbers. My first question is, as you mentioned that there is some changes in the last quarter [Technical issue].",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Pankaj, the audio is not clear from your line. Please use the handset mode.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Pankaj Rawal — Ace Lansdowne Investments Services LLP — Analyst,"Okay, am I clear now?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Yes, sir.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Pankaj Rawal — Ace Lansdowne Investments Services LLP — Analyst,"Hello, am I audible? Sorry. So, yeah, my first question is, sir, you mentioned that we did some changes in last quarter around the tick size like for equities and for the currency options, so last couple of months, have you noticed any traction in the volumes because of this? It this true or [Indecipherable]",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"No, it’s a fair question that you’re asking, what we have seen is in respect of tick size. The market, there are multiple things which we have seen. The overall impact costs in respect of the securities we have found that coming back. If you look at it, what was the origin? The origin is upto INR15, whatever securities were there we had a tick size of INR0.01. We found in respect of these securities, we had a better market-share, better delivery percentages and also we have a better impact costs in respect of these securities. We thought that is very beneficial to the market, we wanted to mimic it for slightly higher number of securities. So we went up to a INR100, whatever is upto INR100, the tick size was changed. We find all the three things holding good. We find the impact cost has come down. Our market-share in these securities used to be around 9%, now it is around 11%, a 2% increase in two months, which is shot, I can say 20% — 20% we can say it has increased in the volume — in the market-share, because from 9% to 11% is roughly that way. It is still a long way to go, but certainly it has started showing green shoots. And in terms of delivery percentages, we are very happy to tell you, around 80% of the total trades in respect of securities upto 100 rupees at BSE results in delivery. When you compare it to the national average of 19% in other exchange. I think is a very big number I feel. So I think the purpose for which we launched this is materializing. But as you also rightly pointed out, it is early days, there will be some more traction happening.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"In respect of equity of currency options, what we found is, in respect of this $0.10 strike rate intervals around 65% of the trading is happening in these strikes. So that means you have made some difference. We have started making some meaningful difference in respect of multiple new partners –participants, who are entering into this market. So these are some early indicators for us. Currency options change came around March 6th, or March 5th, I guess, it’s early days, but I think we are making a dent.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Pankaj Rawal — Ace Lansdowne Investments Services LLP — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Thanks for that. My second question is around that ASBA implementation in the secondary market. So what can be the possible impact for our treasury revenue with ASBA implementation in the secondary market?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Nayan Mehta — Chief Financial Officer;,"It will be too early to comment. It will be too early to comment, Pankaj, because you are talking about ASBA implementation, where the contours of the regulatory change in itself is — it’s not becoming evident. You may like to note that this is not an exercise from SEBI side to increase the revenue of MIIs. It is an exercise from the regulatory side, for improving the investor protection. So the add on which it looked in itself is very different and contours are not clear, so it will be very difficult to give any comment on this stage.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Pankaj Rawal — Ace Lansdowne Investments Services LLP — Analyst,"Okay, okay. No problem. The last question is, what is the cash-and-cash equivalent as on 31st March, cash-and-cash equivalents?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Pankaj, as you know, that we distributed more or less the entire income, which we received during the year. So, and our capex is not very-high as compared to many other organizations. So we still have INR1,400 crore as we would have told you last year also, on calls, we have been telling that and we continue to have INR1,400 crore of free-cash for shareholders in our standalone books.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Pankaj Rawal — Ace Lansdowne Investments Services LLP — Analyst,"INR1,400 crores?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Nayan Mehta — Chief Financial Officer;,Yeah.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Pankaj Rawal — Ace Lansdowne Investments Services LLP — Analyst,"Okay, yeah, sorry, the. I think the last last quarter it was around INR2,200 crore.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Pankaj, that is the total cash in our books. But when you talk about cash books, I generally understand that it is meant to free-cash for shareholders, right?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Pankaj Rawal — Ace Lansdowne Investments Services LLP — Analyst,Got it. Okay. Thank you. That’s all from my side. Thank you very much.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rishabh, an Individual Investor. Please go-ahead.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Rishabh — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Hello. Yeah, am I audible?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,Yes.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Rishabh — Individual Investor — Analyst,Could you please guide me regarding the fee structure in the StAR MF platform?,BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Nayan Mehta — Chief Financial Officer;,"What happens Rishab is that — means — what we recover from the agency towards towards the services, comprises of two-parts, one is the transaction charges for processing the transactions orders. And the second is the recovery of the costs which we incurred and handling any processing those transactions. Fortunately, those transactions.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Nayan Mehta — Chief Financial Officer;,"So there are various slabs which become applicable to different parties depending on different levels of operations. So, I can tell you one thing that the overall recovery for us is about INR4 per transaction.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Nayan, if I may add, Rishabh your question is whether there is any cost to the retail investors. There is no-cost. If you’re — if you’re asking whether there is any, any cost to the intermediaries, there is no-cost. It is what is the recovery what we make from the AMCs for the services we render to the AMCs.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Mr Rishab, your audio is not clear from your line.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Rishabh — Individual Investor — Analyst,Hello?,BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Yes, sir. Please go-ahead.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Rishabh — Individual Investor — Analyst,"Yeah, I’m saying that during [Technical issue] concerned with the core SGF. Can I know the reason for that?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"As Nayan told sometime back, the SGF competition is based on the complex algorithm that works, which takes into account multiple things like volatility, cleared volumes, etcetera, etcetera. So that is the reason because of which, based on the algorithm, the number changes, a number is arrived at and if we have to contribute, we have to contribute. There is a SEBI stipulated algorithm and based on which this happens.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Thank you, Mr. Rishabh, may we request that you return to the question queue for follow-up questions?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,We’ll take the next question from the line of Vikram Kotak from Ace Lansdowne Investments. Please go-ahead.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Vikram Kotak — Ace Lansdowne Investments. — Analyst,"Thank you. I am audible? Hi, Sundar sir, hi, Nayan, hi everyone at BSE. First of all, congratulation for a good set of numbers. I can see a lot sweat In the numbers. And a lot of small, small changes [indecipherable] paying somewhere. So I had two questions, one is the — I don’t know whether — I joined late, so maybe if it’s answered, then you can — sorry for that. So one question which you’ve brought INR0.01 tick size, how do you see this as you know kind of helping because you took a survey for brokers, so how that’s helping you to kind of get more closer to the investors and the broker community? That’s my question number-one.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,Can I answer it?,BSE,BSE Limited 
Vikram Kotak — Ace Lansdowne Investments. — Analyst,Yes.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,Actually you missed the answer. It was a very elaborate answer for it.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Vikram Kotak — Ace Lansdowne Investments. — Analyst,Sorry.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"It’s okay. I will just repeat it in a sort of summarized form. The three guiding factors which because of which we thought we should know this is one is the impact cost, improving derivatives percentage and third is know more investors through market-share. All the three, we are finding some traction. The delivery percentage in respect of these securities at BSE is 79%, around 80%, you can take. The impact cost is significantly reduced in respect of the stocks as we compare it with the other exchange and our market-share, which was hovering around 9% before the change, has gone up to around 11% in these securities overall market-share, that is a 2% increase over a base of 9% increase.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Vikram Kotak — Ace Lansdowne Investments. — Analyst,"Right. Right. And Sundar sir, second question for you is that, I know you started a few months back and we have gone through the first one full-quarter and where do you where do you see in terms of transition and where do you see in terms of low-hanging fruit, in terms of the strategy, do you see a long way to go or you are seeing that things are panning out quite quickly? And this is a difficulty also. It’s not easy to really implement and really see the result because the half year from capital market. Do you see whatever steps you are taking [Indecipherable] of bull market of good run and the equity market, do you see the more operating EBIT will be playing out through what changes we brought till now and what are the more changes till now? That’s my question. Thank you.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"No, I’m honestly not able to answer your first part. If you are asking for what change is in the offering, that is easier to answer. I’m sorry, I did not understand the first part of your question. Can you simplify it in a single-line?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Vikram Kotak — Ace Lansdowne Investments. — Analyst,"I’ll simplify it. Whatever changes we taken — done in last three months, that is the INR0.01 transact, INR0.01 thing or putting the currency derivatives [Indecipherable] bringing no more products, right. But it’s tough year. So it’s not, you can get all benefits in a tough year. So if the year was good, do you a huge operating leverage to play out in all these areas of changes which you brought? That’s my first question.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Okay, so the simple answer to it is, yes, it was a tough year, and I joined in the last quarter and the government is joined immediately you don’t hit the ground running, itt takes some time. Notwithstanding that, we are trying to bring in in the first quarter in itself multiple changes. And as you may be aware, we are launching — relaunching rather Sensex and banking derivatives, in slightly a modified form which is based on market feedback from Monday onwards, I’m sure you’ll be tracking it?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Vikram Kotak — Ace Lansdowne Investments. — Analyst,"Yes, yes.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"And incidentally whoever, any of you are trading, we would like your full support to BSR and these derivative contracts. We feel that they are wonderful contracts for multiple reasons. Sensex as you know is one of the oldest index in India, it represents 30 stocks in 12 sectors. And since there are 20 stocks less than this and two sectors less than this, this is quick, this is sensitive index, that’s why it’s called as Sensex. It incorporates the market price into the — price information into the index very fast. and therefore, that in itself creates a situation of need a live with the other big market index, which is Nifty, giving a lot of product interplay possible between Nifty and Sensex which is, as part — sensex derivatives [Indecipherable] trading.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Apart from that, because our contract is expiring one day late, in respect of people adding positions on Nifty options on Thursday. If they think that they should recover the entire by waiting one more day they will be able to transform the position of Nifty options to Sensex options by paying a smaller [indecipherable] and probably landing up in-the-money. These are just two strategies I’m talking about, there are multiple strategies. This is the reason why we have carefully selected Sensex 30 and Bankex derivatives. Bankex is very akin to bank [indecipherable]. And as you know, both of them enjoy a 99.96% correlation with other indices of the other exchange and they have better volatility profile and the return profile of Sensex is far superior, and the CAGR has been a very-high percentage in the last five years, all these you will be aware of. The reason for bringing this is to rejuvenate the market and bring in vibrancy.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"You were asking me whether we have belief that it will change the operational capability. The honest answer is, yes. As far as what the future plans are, this is the second question that you’ve asked, multiple changes could be there and multiple products could come. We are only talking about two products now and they are both in that index product. Today, if you looked at the market, the market is suffering from a very big concentration risk, the entire volumes are concentrated in a single trading venue, in a single segment, in a single-product with around two or three indices alone. Taking care of almost everything in the market. This is a huge concentration risk, we are seeing in order to provide vibrancy, it’s trying to address this risk for the nation and for the investing public but providing in new products, we are charging with index. We are sure in the to come, we’ll be having more equity-related products coming in derivatives, more indices, broad-basing the market and providing protection to the market from the concentration risk, which er are public, they are covering. This is the vision that we have and it is not going to happen in a day, as you would appreciate, it will take some time. And the entire tenure of mine, which is next four years is there for me to contribute whichever way I can to the growth of the nation and BSE. Supern, superb. All the best sundar sir and all the best to BSE. Thank you so much for elaborate on this. Thank you. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rahul Kumar from New India. Please go-ahead.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Rahul Kumar — New India. — Analyst,"Hello, good evening, sir.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,Good evening.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Rahul Kumar — New India. — Analyst,"Well, my question is what is the future of goal extending and social extending. Are we — in the future, will get some revenue from this segment?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Sorry which? Gold, what you said?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Rahul Kumar — New India. — Analyst,Gold exchange and Social exchange.,BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"See Social exchange you will not be able to get any — That’s not a revenue making exercise, that is a contribution to the society Gold actually enable access to social exchange, you will not be able to get any, that’s not the revenue, making exercise, that is a contribution to the society as a corporate citizen, what we all need to do. From social stock exchange, at least at this point of time, I’m not expecting any revenue. I am here to serve the larger part of the sections of the society through SSE.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"Gold bullion exchange is a separate exchange which is the shareholding of multiple other exchanges. So it is a fledgling exchange. Gold has a great potential in India, we are talking about 800 tons and whatnot, but still we are not the price setup. So India is having interest in trying to make India the price setter for gold. I’m sure, since it’s a single exchange with multiple people joining together to promote this exchange, this is — and this being in GIFT City, which which is very close to our heart, a nation’s interest, I’m sure in the coming days, it will grow well.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"I’m not sure whether you are tracking our EGR, that is another effort for onshore participants we have put in-place, it is early days. There are some teething troubles in terms of taxation and other areas, we feel we will be serving the market better very soon with some changes, if it comes through, through the e-gold circle within India.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Rahul Kumar — New India. — Analyst,"My next question is how much revenue we’ll get from power [Indecipherable] We have from shareholdings from Hindustan Power, do you get some revenue from that?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Nayan Mehta — Chief Financial Officer;,"So Rahul, right now we are not earning any revenues or share of revenue from HP, it’s still in the process of, it’s a new exchange and it will take its own time to grow up and add revenues. So with, it will be very difficult to — I think it’ll be very difficult to say what type of revenue-share or profit-share we can get from them. I will be providing technology to them through our group company, BSE Technologies and that is the revenue which we have against our services to them. So we will probably have to wait for some time before we get some return from the investment to share made in HP.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Rahul Kumar — New India. — Analyst,"Okay, thank you. Thank you sir.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we’ll take the last question from the line of Prayesh Jain from Motilal Oswal. Please go-ahead.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, thanks for the opportunity again. Firstly, on the existing businesses fund, finance transaction charges or listing fees, any thoughts on increasing — increasing the rates in FY ’24?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"See, I probably do not understand the question, are you talking about transaction charges or listing fees, which one you talking about, or both?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,"Both, both, I’m asking. Whether any thoughts of increasing them in the — in times to come.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"The rates are sort of competitive rates as far as listing is concerned, so unilaterally, to make a comment that we will increase is not possible. It is, it’s not any sort of giant effort to increase or decrease, but the market is very competitive, so accordingly the pricing gets made, so it will be a function of multiple things, where the — where the entire market is moving towards in terms of capital rising, IPOs that come into market, [Indecipherable] that come into the market and on and on, And so that’s what, it is — it is not a unilateral point of time decision to say that yes, indeed, we will be raising listing fee, that is one part.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"On the transaction charges. I’m not sure whether you missed the point which. I was making slightly earlier. We do charge a subsidized rates in multiple areas and we don’t charge some in some areas. If you look at it, for example, in equity options our charges are very low, currency options are our is almost 1/10th I guess, compared to the competitor and in respect of equity futures, we do not charge anything at all. Point of time, it is not making a difference, because we are not having much of a market-share to boast. But we are doing everything to ensure that we will get some market-share. So as and when we will get market-share, will we be revising the charges, meaning will we be introducing charges? Yes, we will be introducing. We have already started charging certain services which we were not charging before. Like for example, in Codo[phonetic] where we it was all free earlier, which was in a way taking some amount of the P&L, right, so which was talked about, the technology scheme which has talked about. So today, we have started defraying the cost, so like that, in currency again, to mention our charges are 1/5th of what the competition charges.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Sundararaman Ramamurthy — Managing Director and CEO,"So there are scope for us to increase, we are trying to deepen the markets and once we are deepening the market, certainly we will be working towards increasing the charges and taking care of the shareholders revenues increase as well.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,"On the StAR MF you mentioned that it’s INR4, but if I look at FY ’23, it’s far lower than that, so, is that the run-rate that we should look-forward going ahead or how should we think about that?",BSE,BSE Limited 
Mr. Nayan Mehta — Chief Financial Officer;,"It’s like that. Over a period of time, as our volumes increase, the adverse labs will get applicable. And to that extent, that’ll be a downward trend with respect to average charges which are earning per transaction. But as you will note that we are able to influence our revenue by almost 55% from INR50 crores to INR78 crores in this current — in this current year. So obviously, with higher transactions coming on — coming on us, obviously, that will have an upward, that can have an upward thing — impact on our revenues.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Prayesh Jain — Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. — Analyst,"Got that. Got that. Yeah, that’s it from my side. Thank you and all the best.",BSE,BSE Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Anand for closing comments.

Some of the statements made on today’s call could be forward-looking in nature and actual results could vary from these forward-looking statements. A detailed disclosure in this regard is available in the results presentation. Which is available on the stock exchange website.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Siddharth Rangnekar — Moderator,I would now like to invite Dr. Lal to share his perspectives. Thank you and over to you sir.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Hon. Brig. Dr. Arvind Lal — Executive Chairman,"Thank you, Siddharth, a very good evening, and a warm welcome, to everyone present on this call. We are here to discuss Dr. Lal PathLabs Q4 FY ’23 earnings and I would like to take you all through the key developments and updates during the period under review. India requires quality diagnostics of scale. Over the years we have tracked gradual evolution of the way doctors and patients manage disease and health. Accurate diagnostics is increasingly contributing throughout the treatment process, including health management, disease detection, prognosis, diagnosis, treatment planning and post-treatment monitoring. We therefore continue to invest in creating an efficient technology that network, that’s get aligned with the growth in sample volumes.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Hon. Brig. Dr. Arvind Lal — Executive Chairman,"To start with, I’m delighted to share the Dr. Lal PathLabs has stocked 15.5% growth in the non-COVID revenue in FY ’23, we have proudly served, about 27 million patients in FY ’23. This has come on the back of a sharp focus on core operations across country, including Tier two and Tier three cities and investments in the digital infrastructure. We have continued to make progress across our three strategic pillars, that is geographical expansion, creating a unique and specialized portfolio and augmenting the technology infrastructure for the future. The highlight was the unveiling of our Mumbai reference lab at Vidyanagar in January this year. This has immediately resulted in the increased testing of the high-end test and in the first — it is also the first private lab in West India, to have a BSL Level-3 bio containment lab.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Hon. Brig. Dr. Arvind Lal — Executive Chairman,"This speaks leaps and bounds of our commitment to offer best-in class services to our patients by bringing accurate diagnosis at reasonable prices to the full. We also added a second electron microscope at our National Reference Lab in Rohini in Delhi. At this point, I would like to remind you that Dr. Lal PathLabs already has world’s largest histopathology testing center or load processing up to 1,400 biopsies a day and also the largest kidney biopsy testing center. We were the first private lab in South Asia and Southeast Asia to have an electronic microscope way back-in 2016.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Hon. Brig. Dr. Arvind Lal — Executive Chairman,"Furthermore, I am pleased to share that we continue to work towards enhancing our technological capabilities. We have begun implementing an upgraded lab information systems and advanced tools like artificial intelligence and data mining. These have enabled us to achieve enhanced operational efficiencies and quicker turnaround times or TAT. We continue to add new tests to our test menu and have diversified our reach to higher franchise share of patient service centers. Our processes are tools to drive trust towards our brand and therefore, I think we are uniquely placed to both drive and benefit from the expansion in consumption of diagnostics forwards.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Hon. Brig. Dr. Arvind Lal — Executive Chairman,Thank you very much and I would now like to hand over the floor to Dr. Om. Over to you Dr. Om.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"Thank you, Dr. Lal. Welcome everyone to Dr. Lal PathLabs Q4 and FY ’23 earnings call. I hope that you and your loved ones are keeping safe and healthy. I’ll share a few of the industry and business insights that I see emerging based on FY ’23 results. During the entire FY ’23 in quarterly commentaries, I’ve always been highlighting that we should analyze — annualize instead of what really trends. Now since the financial year is over the entire analysis becomes a bit more meaningful and we have full-year numbers in front of us of FY ’23.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"While FY ’22 was operationally very challenging due to very-high incidents of Delta and subsequent overhang of travel-related tests requirements and [Technical Issues] like Omicron, etc. In contrast to FY ’22 we experienced FY ’23 turned out to be financially very challenging for the entire industry due to the following reasons. Number 1, nearly 80% to 90% decline in COVID and COVID-related revenues. The higher the contribution of COVID testing to the total revenue, because the challenge.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"The second is inability to roll-back capacities and manpower and region stocks due to unpredictability of the future COVID demand pattern. On the other hand, FY ’23 also experienced uneven quarterly base and coupled with aggressive competitive activities further made it difficult for all of us in understanding the underlying growth trends. Now since FY ’23 is over, I really thank you friends. So, my faith is the following. Number-1, bundled packages have become way of life in our industry. Our contribution of [Technical Issues] first-fit to total revenue has further gone up to 22% in-quarter four. This means we are doing higher number of tests per patient and that’s very clearly visible in on sample volumes as well.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"Number-2, our CAGR trends based on — this is our internal estimates, of a few large players, their data is in public domain that also include the inorganic assets and residual FY ’23 covered revenues over four years suggests that some of these players have experienced all put together [Technical Issues] growth rate of 10% to 11%. This may not be reflective of the entire industry growth, but if I look at all the data put together of — in public domain, I am seeing CAGR of 10% to 11%.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"Number-3, after a long gap, we saw in Q4, some of the players have taken price increase and we also did little bit in the month of February. We will talk about that.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"Number-4, as the pressure on margins buildup in the industry, especially on smaller and mid-sized players. We do see consolidation opportunities emerging [Technical Issues] however, valuation expectations and unavailability of quality assets will make this journey a little difficult. On suburban diagnostics, as a platform, we have now set for next phase of integration as Dr. Lal mentioned that we’ve built a state-of-art reference lab in Vidyavihar in the month of January this year.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"Second is, as all of you know that COVID contributed nearly 50% of the total revenue of the suburban year FY ’22. It is now down to just 6% in FY ’23. The stage is definitely set for next phase wherein we plan to bring in and now back-end synergies between the parent company LPS [Phonetic] as well as suburban diagnostics and go further aggressive in Mumbai and Western India [Phonetic]. In the end, I would say the brands that have the trust of the patient and medical fraternity holistically invested in-network creation, infrastructure scale-up, patient services, etc., will sustain and grow in the long-run.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"With that now, I would like to invite our CEO, Bharath to continue this conversation. Thank you and over to you. Thank you, Om. A very good evening to everyone present here and I warmly welcome you all to our Q4 FY ’23 Earnings Conference Call. I will now take you through some of the operating and business highlights of our company. In Q4 FY ’23, we registered 6.3 million patient visits, generating a total revenue of rupees for INR491 crores. COVID [Indecipherable] has declined 83% and contributed to only INR11 crores. That it’s just 2% of the overall revenue. During the full financial year, we registered 26.9 patient visits and generated a total revenue of INR2017 crores. You would remember last year in Q4, we had a pronounced Omicron wave of COVID with high testing volumes, comparable to the end of Delta wave. As a result, test mix profile shifted significantly. Hence for analysis purposes one must look beyond Y-o-Y growth and use other metrics like sequential in 3-year CAGR numbers. Our non-COVID revenue at INR480 crores registered a Y-o-Y growth of 14.4% and follow historical sequential trends within Q3 and Q4. The tests per patient also moved up, from INR2.48 rate in Q4 FY ’22 to INR2.76 in Q4 FY ’23 representing 11.2% growth in non-COVID tests conducted. Underlying non-COVID patients visits in the organic business grew nearly 8%. As you’re aware, we had taken some price corrections in the month of February ’23, the same has got settled and has been absorbed by various segments of our customers. According to our estimates, this price correction has had a 1.7% impact in this quarter and 2.7% [Phonetic] on the ongoing basis. We have been focused on four strategies programs. Building a bundled test portfolio [Technical Issues], super specialty business, enhancing digital capabilities and geographic expansion including serving Tier-3 and Tier-4. Like Om mentioned our bundled tests portfolio continues to do very well and it contributed nearly 22% of Q4 ’23 of non-COVID business. Overall, trusted portfolio generated a revenue of INR370 crores in FY ’23. [Indecipherable] portfolio led by genomic testing division Genevolve, Center of Excellence for Reproductive Diagnostics, L-CoRD and Center for Autoimmunity Excellence L- ACE is becoming, similar to the Swastik portfolio in size and growth rate. Our expansion program aimed at reaching the interiors of the country in Tier-3 plus towns our Bharat continues unabated. We now have 277 labs at the year end at year end, including 17 labs at Tier-3 like [Indecipherable] and Sulthanpur in the North. We continue to invest in scalable and profitable digital programs combined in medical excellence and leveraging digital and analytical capabilities, improve patient journey. I would like to talk about three visual properties recently launched and scaled-up today, namely Chips, Recommendation Engine, and Patient Wallet. Our Chips customer health improvement plan is designed to engage our patients digitally with personal personalized digital interventions — digital diagnostic interventions. Further, we have made an Recommendation Engine that share the specific tests at the point-of-sales. All these programs, combined with the Patient Wallet will provide personalized scalable digital customer relationship management program. We are receiving good customer traction on this program since their launch. We believe we have the right set of building blocks which we have put in-place in the marketplace with a few more in the pipeline and this we believe will help us deliver industry-leading growth rates. With that I would like to invite Ved to take you all through the financial performance. Over to you, Ved.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Ved Prakash Goel — Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Bharat. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining this call. I am now sharing some of the key financial highlights for Q4 and FY ’23. Our non-COVID revenue for Q4 FY ’23 came in at INR480 crores versus INR420 crores last year same quarter. A growth of 14.4%.

Ved Prakash Goel — Group Chief Financial Officer,"Total revenue for FY ’23 came in at INR2,017 crores versus INR2,087 crores in FY ’22. Revenue realization per patient for Q4 FY ’23 is INR774 against INR728 last year same quarter, an increase of 6%, led by price increase, test mix and higher contribution of Swastik. Normalized EBITDA after eliminating the impact of RSU, PSR and one exceptional expenses for Q4 FY ’23 trees came in at INR131 crores and INR528 crores for FY ’23. Normalized EBITDA margin for Q4, is at 26.6% and 26.2% for FY ’23.

And INR400 crores for FY ’23 versus INR494 crores in FY ’22. Normalized PBT margin is 20.8% for Q4 FY ’23 and 19.8% for FY ’22 — sorry, FY ’23. Normalized PAT for Q4 FY ’23 came in at INR76 crores versus is INR73 crores in Q4 for FY ’22 and INR297 crores for FY ’23, versus INR369 crores in FY ’22.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd

Net of borrowing, is INR601 crores. I’m pleased to share that our efforts towards optimizing costs and increasing the operational efficiency by using the technology and digital tools has resulted in reducing our debt [Phonetic] outstanding and inventory to 28 days now. So, one-side we are doing efforts on front-end, patient side, as Bharat mentioned that digital technology has given the hedge. Another fact on the operational side, we are taking technology and tools to optimize the cost.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Ved Prakash Goel — Group Chief Financial Officer,"Finally, we are pleased to share that the Board of Directors has proposed a final dividend of INR6 per share. With this the total dividend for FY ’23 is INR12 per share. Final dividend will be paid after the shareholders’ approval in the upcoming AGM. This brings me to the conclusion of my opening remarks, and now I would request the moderator to open the forum for Q&A. Thank you.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Ved Prakash Goel — Group Chief Financial Officer,Questions and Answers:,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen we will wait for a moment while the question queue assembles. The first question is from the line of Rahul Agarwal from InCred Capital. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, good evening. Thank you for the opportunity. Two questions, firstly, I noticed revenue mix largely shifting to outside Delhi NCR. So, obviously, other geographies are doing better. B2B is bit higher Y-o-Y and [Technical Issues] is obviously growing faster. All of this combined, on the question for you, does this result in margin dilution for fiscal ’24 for Y-o-Y? That’s my first question.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,Margin dilution for FY ’24 you said?,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,Yeah.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"We don’t think so we — we our margins if you look at our nearing our pre-COVID levels with the COVID impact is also even in FY ’24 also, we believe that we should be able to sustain [Technical Issues].",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"In-spite of these three things, gaining revenue-share? Delhi, outside our B2B and [Technical Issues].",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"Yeah, you see outside NCR one must realize that as the scale picks up there are there are markets, which actually mimic like Delhi NCR. And if you notice in the last sort of four to five years, our expansion through lab network is actually not that fast as it seems to be earlier. Because most of it is now building through hubs [Phonetic], where our tendencies is now to open more collection points [Technical Issues]. So, I think we are actually optimizing the costs [Technical Issues] our margins don’t get dilutive. So that’s the way we see it. And in any case, if you look at earlier portfolio mix, we always had some markets which are operating on a lower-margin, but our risk not now is fairly scaled-up margins are there pretty healthy there.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Perfect, got it, and secondly again [Speech Overlap]",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"Variation is not material enough, so that’s the way [Technical Issues].",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Got it, and secondly, on the growth side of it, obviously, the starting first quarter of fiscal ’24, the base is supportive because we no more have very large COVID revenues. Life is coming back to normal. Obviously, that helps in getting normal diseases and hence normal testing for non-COVID should pickup. Employee attrition is generally low now in favor of digital labs and what I understand from term checks [Phonetic] and obviously growth outside Delhi NCR is faster than Delhi NCR. So combined of all of this, do you see 13% to 14% revenue growth next year?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"So, I think instead of me putting a number, clearly I do believe that we entered in FY ’23 on [Technical Issues] digital outside environment in FY ’24, as you — you outlined it very well pressure on attrition is very low. Our [Indecipherable] fixed-price increase there. We have demonstrated that COVID pressure should be rolled back capacity on large. We buy some more stocks etc. That is also behind us. So, the good news is that we are now entering into FY ’24, in a bigger slate, with a less sort of headwinds compared to what we saw last year. I think overall it augurs well. Now coming to growth rate, it’s very difficult to put a number right now, but I definitely do believe that they should do better than what we’ve done previously.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Got it. Perfect. And lastly, just a bookkeeping, the 26.6 million patients non-COVID for full-year, could you break-down that into Dr. Lal and suburban separately.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,For FY ’23?,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, 26.6 million patients.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,We have that number.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, Rahul, because we have not — the suburban was not fully maintained this year. So probably these numbers, may not give the right picture. So, at this point, I think this is the consolidated number we have.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"For us, if we look at suburban so far our tendency was to show separately, because in some quarters, we didn’t have a base. So now since that sort of issue is no more with us, we want to operationally see as if like both [Technical Issues] and suburban, they go hand-in-hand together. So we would want to actually highlight suburban separately if that’s available, that’s the way we look at it.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Can I get it for fourth quarter in that case, that’s the Y-o-Y comparison, right?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,But I’ll come back to you.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"The number, I think is immediately not available with us, we’ll come back.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Rahul Agarwal — InCred Capital — Analyst,"Okay, perfect. I’ll come back-in the queue. Thank you so much. All the best.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,Thank you.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Prakash Kapadia from Anived Portfolio Managers. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. Couple of questions from my end. There have been price hikes in the industry by new age players, any change in competitive landscape we are witnessing? And given that growth in industry have generally come down post COVID, so any acceleration or any trends, we are witnessing or sensing shift from unorganized or shift from regional players for national players like us, that is the first question.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"We also taken some price hikes in our portfolio. So, if you could help us understand the impact of revenues for FY ’24 and is it in speciality? Is it in packages? Is it in specific geographies? If you could highlight that. And the third question is, you know, in our endeavor to drive organic growth, what should be the key drivers for that in FY ’24 and beyond? So obviously suburban scale is one of the factor, but how is non-metro contribution shaping up? How is the new patient addition happening, new tests? Some of these points will be helpful if you can clarify.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Hi, Prakash, this is Bharat here.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"Hi, Bharat.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,Let me start with the first question on how the competition intensity shaping up in the industry right?,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,Yeah.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, there are two-three ways to look at it. One is that the incumbent players and let’s say some of the newer traditional players model players let’s say for sake of any other better word, continue to intensely be competitive in the marketplace. So, there is no let down on that count. So, including new entrants, regional labs chains, etc. all continue to compete very aggressively in the marketplace like in the past. What we are seeing is that some of this new-age E-com based Google advertising, Facebook advertising, based companies because of it may be funding pressure or because they not able to see the traction themselves, are scaling down, let us say, deep discounting because patients are also now realizing that these discounting’s are actually click bait [Phonetic] operation, that is they finally end-up paying the money they pay similar money to what we pay to one of the incumbent players.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, I think, it is all catching-up and the industry is a bit of a transitionary phase. Everyone is trying to innovate and try and do the best he can. So that is the way to look at the land competitive landscape today, but yes, advertising intensity has mainly come down at least from an ATL [Phonetic] above-the-line perspective. Digital media competition still continues very intensely.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"Okay, okay, so [Speech Overlap]",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,This is going to take time.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"So, Bharat effectively you are saying this would take time and there is no major shift it’s — it’s maybe the pace has decreased, but it remains as competitive as it was.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, yeah. [Technical Issues] I think the world has come to a new age — new world wherein less competition and things back. It is still intensely competitive. All of us fighting for our share of the business. But some segments of competition has kind of come down.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"Okay, okay.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, the second question revolves around just remind me on…",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"It was about price hikes which we have taken. So is it for specialty portfolio? Is it specific geographies and the impact of that, if any, on next year and going-forward?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, we have not taken any price increase on routine tests, and the most commonly ordered tests, including packages. So that is a first statement I would like to make. We have taken price increase on what is really is on [Indecipherable] test, high-end test, done in reference lab only and so on and so forth. And I talked about that in the what I would call the opening speech, a 1.7% impact for this quarter and 2.5% estimated going-forward assuming the mix holds up.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"Okay, okay.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Right, it was not geography specific, it is pan-India basis and really blood tests which are less frequently ordered for consumers and patients, [Technical Issues]. The good news is that all of the partners from where the samples predominantly come from have largely accepted the price increase. We are not finding major impact or push-back as a result of this, because it’s been long overdue. They also realize that they have also taken-up prices, so I think it is gone well and execution was planned for.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"Sure, that’s it.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"And on the third question of growth levers going-forward, Dr. Lal covered this. Dr. Om covered this. I also covered this. There are three or four, please look at it. One is geographic expansion, in Tier-3, Tier-4 cities along with strengthening our metro city presence either in where we operate in Northeast also including Mumbai. So, there is A, is geographic expansion plan. Second, we have differentiated channel management programs. We talked about that, I think last quarters also on how do we manage B2B separately than B2C. We have talent management programs, driving growth through channel partners.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"You obviously spoke about today, high-end testing is that the genomic testing all the Centers of Excellence on Reproductive Diagnostics or Autoimmune all key take aways to differentiate your business while delivering value to all stakeholders. The fourth is obviously getting the tech stack-up to share, so that we constantly provide an [Technical Issues] factor to the patient saying something new has happened. So, we spoke about the chips program today. We spoke about the recommendation engine and also the wallet.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"Right, right.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, I know it’s a combination of what we have done traditionally with is geographic expansion, combining with obviously [Technical Issues] and super specialty portfolio and layering an tech component to that.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Kapadia — Anived Portfolio Managers — Analyst,"Right, right, right. Fine, fine, that’s, that’s helpful. I have one or two more questions. Maybe, I’ll join back the queue. Thanks.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Prakash.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. Before we move to the next question, I’d like to remind our participants to limit your questions to two per participant. If time permits, you may join the queue for any follow-up. Thank you. The next question is from the line of [Indecipherable] from Elara Capital. Please go ahead.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,"Hi, good afternoon. Just a quick clarification, when you see the price increases you took will have an impact of 2.5% is that on your overall revenue or on just the portfolio on which you have taken price increases?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,On the overall revenue.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,Okay and what are your plans for addition of labs for FY ’24 and ’25?,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, our lab expansion program continues, the way it has always been about 10 to 15 labs predominantly in Tier-3, Tier-4 cities spread across North-East and some portions of South and West.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Unidentified Participant — — Analyst,"Understood. Great, thank you.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Lavanya from UBS. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Lavanya — UBS — Analyst,"Hi sir, thanks for the opportunity. So I just wanted to understand margins for suburban, in this quarter just because last quarter we have seen a meaningful hit.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,So normalized EBITDA margins for suburban for this quarter is about 11.2% and for full year it is 12%.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Lavanya — UBS — Analyst,"Okay, so we are still seeing the impact of the new franchise opened on the margin from suburban.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"So, no I think on suburban if you go back pre-COVID times that was the trajectory of the business in any case. I think during COVID times they experienced very-high leverage because suburban has experienced a very sharp drop of COVID revenue this year from nearly INR113 crores it has fall to this INR9 crore. The P&L shape is very similar to let’s say what it used to be pre-COVID times. But the important thing is that this has nearly platform of nearly INR155 crores of revenue. 80% of that comes from the city of Mumbai. And now with the sort of the support of Centralised Lab and LPL parent support, we are basically hoping to drive this both revenue synergies as well the cost side synergies, with a slight higher margins, but this is a margin which it used to have pre-COVID times.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"And these margins, please note that we have launched this big reference lab in Mumbai. So, this quarter the only impact of that reference has also [Speech Overlap]",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Lavanya — UBS — Analyst,"Okay, got it. So, one more thing on the exceptional expense that you have seen in the current quarter, what was it related to? And I just wanted to, understand the tax-rate guidance that you gave for next financial year FY ’24?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, this exceptional item is one large amount is receivable from BMC, Bombay Municipal Corporation. As per policy we have provided, but we are hopeful that this money will — will come to us very soon. And second, a small amount which has been provided for COVID inventory which is going to expire. So, these are the exceptional item.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Lavanya — UBS — Analyst,"Okay, on the tax-rate?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Tax-rate, we have normal tax-rate, which is about 25% for the corporate. There is nothing which is exceptional here, normal tax-rate.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Lavanya — UBS — Analyst,"Okay, thank you all the best. Thanks for the opportunity.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Prakash Agarwal from Axis Capital. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, good evening. First question is on, just trying to understand the price increase, you mentioned it is for specialized test. How has been the experience versus the competition? Has the competition followed you? Have you lost some business because of price hike or it is status quo and it is value-accretive?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So hi, Bharat here. So, two-three things, one is that this price increase has gone relatively well. We were skeptical in the beginning, but I think the execution was near-perfect and communicating to customers on why this price increase and in the context of the overall tenure of the price increases this seemed to be logical and reasonable to them.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Number two, we explain the impact that over 2.5% on an ongoing basis on the overall portfolio, given the mix of the portfolio with which this price increase has been taken. Yes, now and we also have not taken price increase on the routine portfolio, the most common order test portfolio or the health packages and so on or the bundle test packages.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Now, with competition follow, each company will follow its own what I would call, policies, procedures, priorities, etc., but given the inflationary situation, the lowering of COVID volumes. I do expect that everyone will take price increase as per their areas of strength and what they think they should be doing. So yes, in industry price should start to move-up.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Okay, and the price increase would be only for your specialized which is about 30%, 35% or lower in terms of total volume value?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, it’s on value basis, it is about nearly 50% of the portfolio is only we have taken.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Okay, and 50% [Technical Issues] specialized testing menu?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,It is not only specialized — specialized plus I said less frequently order tests and so on.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay fair enough. Okay and the second question was trying to understand the competitive environment in the B2B segment. We hear that the new players are getting very aggressive, especially on the B2B side. And your progress in the south, please? Thank you.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so on the B2B side the responses that yes, it is as competitive as ever. We have put in-place multiple programs to better manage this channel and segment was channel like we do for patients so we have a B2B channel program, which is very intense and very well appreciated. And in fact, B2B is one of our fast-growing channels today as well compared to historical averages. So, we’re very pleased with the progress the sole approach of channel management program, on the overall revenue growth rates.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"On South also progress is — continuous. We grew South at a reasonable pace compared to what I would call it the company growth rate. We grew ahead of the company growth significantly. So, I think, yes, we will continue to build deeper penetration in South and the geographies where we currently operate in.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"So B2B, you would have grown what you’re saying, you’ve done well [Speech Overlap].",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,We have good growth rates on B2B.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,And margin accretion or flattish?,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so if you manage the mix as well as, the cost structure well and there is also scope negotiate the backend costs. So I think it plays out well enough. Also, as the volume growth as testing efficiencies come in, we are able to amortize lot of control calibration cost etc.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Okay, fair enough, okay. I have no more questions.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Anish Deora from Nomura. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Anish Deora — Nomura — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, thanks for the opportunity. Sir, I’m looking at the quarter-on-quarter sequential data 4Q and 3Q. So while the realization per patient has improved and even the number of tests per patient and the number of samples processed have shown an uptake, but if you see the number of patients, that is the patient volume, they have shown a decline over 3Q, which was supposed to be a seasonally weaker quarter a strong 4Q. So can you share your thoughts around this decline. And is it pointing out to any particular trend that you are seeing that we have a bearing on the coming periods?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, on patient visits. I don’t think we should get swung by quarter-on-quarter movements. There is not a base issue last quarter this quarter and last year, this year, etc. Like I mentioned in the opening comments, our underlying patient visit growth rate is nearly 8%, visit to visit, number of tests performed, is at 11% and revenues obviously, highest.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Anish Deora — Nomura — Analyst,"Got it, got it. Thank you, that’s from my side.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nitin Agarwal from DAM Capital, please go ahead.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital — Analyst,"Sir, thanks for taking my question. Two questions, one is on the operational base. We’ve seen some reduction in employee costs, on a Y-o-Y and Q-o-Q basis Likewise if I adjust for the — the one-off that you mentioned about INR7 odd crores, even other expenses are down. So, how — what should we attribute to these reductions to given the fact that business has been growing?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"So, while we’re taking the statistics at an overall well — these business opening comment talked about use of technology, in automating our processes, etc. So that has given us a large headcount, what I would call leverage. But for specifics around rest of the equation Ved will take on.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Ved Prakash Goel — Group Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, so Nitin, so this is primarily because of RSU charge which is lower than last year. That is the precise reason for the compensation of employee cost. So, this is one. Other expenses, obviously we had lot of programs run in this year, I mean, last year where efficiency has been created as in my opening our remarks also. Lot of use of technology tools. We have created and duplication of the — replication of the work, which can be used by technology tools. So those have given some advantage and that’s why we have got some advantage on other expenses.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital — Analyst,"And secondly on the [Technical Issues], we have the full-year numbers and you have some more clarity on the post COVID trends, what is the realistic ballpark range that one should work with in terms of the patient testing volume growth for us?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Ved Prakash Goel — Group Chief Financial Officer,Volume means patients you are saying.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, patient volume growth, yes, going-forward. I mean on a directional basis it’s a late single-digit, early double-digit, mid double-digit, what is the realistic number that given the industry dynamics, we can work with?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"See, it’s very difficult to put a figure, but as I made [Technical Issues] first question is on the losses. We do believe that FY ’24 numbers should really be greater than last year figures. I think all sort of variables are pointing towards that. We will not have that sort of a competitive scenario as we experienced last year. And as you mentioned that since COVID is not there actually. In one-way, good news as we have done with it and make money [Technical Issues] otherwise, invest in [Technical Issues] and now we can completely focus on non-COVID business. I think the only thing we are not having with us is, I think INR63 crore of COVID [Technical Issues] COVID in the life business in our phase. We don’t know, it’s highly unpredictable. It can actually [Technical Issues] as well. It could be same, but I think if I take that out, we definitely are hopeful of improving our performance metrics.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital — Analyst,"And just lastly on that, typically from a seasonal perspective is in Q4, supposedly a better quarter for the diagnostic business in Q3?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Ved Prakash Goel — Group Chief Financial Officer,"No-no, I’ve mentioned in the opening speech, saying that sequentially Q3 and Q4 are similar for us. I think, it’s a fair [Speech Overlap]",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"I think we’ve also made this comment in the past, but I think for last two-three years, I’m seeing that the variation come due to infections. And for some reason, I find that you are not following the pattern because Q3 no more [Speech Overlap] anymore, even in Q3, also we are having lot of infections. So in some way Q3 actually has moved up. While in Q4, they have been similar. So that’s why the defense industry is much less than before. Let’s see how it happens this year. Because the COVID thing has always been there. Infact, we told respiratory infection in general has been there in the population. I think let just this wait out for FY ’24, but you’re right. Q3 is simply a softer quarter, but we have not seen that trend last couple of years.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital — Analyst,"And since you mentioned that point infections. We’ve seen very-high intensity of incidents rather of infections for the whole of FY ’23 which is reflected in, I guess the pharmaceutical sales of anti-infectives and all the cold and cough preparations. I mean has it had in your assessment, any tailwind for our business also.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Hon. Brig. Dr. Arvind Lal — Executive Chairman,"Actually, respiratory infections is generally do not really selectively for very-high jump-in testing. In fact while we were all talking about during this month of April and even in March also we talked about COVID etc. We didn’t see that it sort of jump in COVID testing. But I think one place, which normally tends to work in situation like this is PRB inflammatory marker. So that is one place we have seen there a significant jump in this Q4. So CRP is wanted for the [Technical Issues].",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital — Analyst,"And lastly, on the realization per patient, obviously with the bundling that we are doing, that’s sort of going up, we are what 780 or thereabouts for this quarter. I mean, how does one look at this number? Is there a significant scope for appreciation from these levels of this number?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Hon. Brig. Dr. Arvind Lal — Executive Chairman,"I don’t think so. It has suburban cycles. I think there are few things that have gone into this one is of course bundle packages now contents going up [Indecipherable]. I don’t foresee a very sharp jump the [Indecipherable]. I think it should stabilize around December. Suburban in general has a higher realization and Dr. Lal PathLabs, so that also has gone in for the full-year impact. I think whatever little will come now into the price increase that we’ve taken in the month of February, maybe that we have some marginal impacts. Mix may not change my — my gut says that you may not see sharp jump this in FY ’24.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital — Analyst,Thank you. best of luck.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Cyndrella Carvalho from JM Financial Limited. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Cyndrella Carvalho — JM Financial Limited — Analyst,Thanks for the — actually I am audible?,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Yes.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Cyndrella Carvalho — JM Financial Limited — Analyst,"Yeah, sir, if we are looking at the volume growth you in your opening remark quite interestingly highlighted the Mumbai lab. We know our earlier lab whenever they have come, they have given us a good traction. So, what do you think about the Mumbai lab? How it will contribute to our overall patient growth like, how should we relate this? If you can help us understand this?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Shankha Banerjee — Chief Executive Officer of Suburban and Other Group,"Hi, this is Shankha here. So, so the Mumbai lab has been launched in — in January, and so the thing is it’s going to be a slightly longer wavelengths compared to the other reference lab because from the suburban point-of-view, it’s kind of starting a completely new vertical, so to say in terms of the specialized business and also trying to get a completely new customer client profile under — to be built under the portfolio that we are currently doing. So, from that point-of-view, yes, the from the last quarter, it will definitely have better impact in terms of patient growth, but it may not be exactly comparable in terms of the things which we saw in East Calcutta or Bengaluru, which might take a slightly longer wavelengths.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Cyndrella Carvalho — JM Financial Limited — Analyst,"Understandable and in your opening remarks, you also mentioned about a slightly higher cost there that we carried for the entire FY ’23. So now if we look at our cost base versus the growth that we have seen at least the normalization, that we have seen in FY ’23, do you think [Technical Issues] your FY ’24 and ’25 this cost base will support us on the growth? And you should see some operating leverage also?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Ved Prakash Goel — Group Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, Cyndrella, Ved here. So definitely, see that idea because one is launching this reference lab, which will obviously give advantage and what Shankha is saying on B2B side. But another, because as you know, all the infrastructure is in-place and I think you also have visited that lab. Now we have to leverage this infra. In our view, the efforts is more on topline, but similarly, the operating leverage will also come on the bottom-line. So, I believe that margins from here should improve.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Cyndrella Carvalho — JM Financial Limited — Analyst,"Okay, that is helpful. And also, if we try and understand the overall marketing scenario today as you highlighted that there is some sluggishness, there is — the great intensity continues, we have taken specialized price increases, but this specialized price increase should reflect across the entire year, right. I mean, we just started in month of February. Is that understanding correct?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,Yes indeed.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Cyndrella Carvalho — JM Financial Limited — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Thank you so much for my questions. Thanks you.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Hon. Brig. Dr. Arvind Lal — Executive Chairman,Thank you.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rishi Mody from Marcellus Investment Managers. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Rishi Mody — Marcellus Investment Managers — Analyst,"Yeah, my question has been asked already earlier, I try to remove myself [Technical Issues].",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tanmay Gandhi from Investec. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Tanmay Gandhi — Investec — Analyst,"Hi sir. Thanks for taking my questions. Sir, first question is on the sequential growth rate. If you look strictly historically look at our sequential growth in 4Q it had reached between 3% to 5%, right. From which time, it was flat. So — so anything — anything worth highlighting here?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"We couldn’t hear your question properly. Could you repeat yourself, if you don’t mind.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,Your line is not clear.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Tanmay Gandhi — Investec — Analyst,Is it better?,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,Better.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Tanmay Gandhi — Investec — Analyst,"Yeah, so sir, my question is that you know is historically if you look at our sequential growth for 4Q, so historically, it has ranged between 3% to 5%, right. But this year it is flat, so anything particular you would like to highlight here?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"So that’s what I actually mentioned, your observation is right. It’s not 3% to 5%, normally, it’s about 2%. And the 2% actually is [Technical Issues] so sometimes depending on the infection rate it is flat, but I am seeing this trend for last two years even I think if I remember, even the sales, here also we saw the same thing. So, my hypothesis is that now just evened out in terms of infection rates. Earlier Q3 was seen as a healthy quarter. I think now because of air pollution, etc., all these things, generally the [Foreign Speech] which is more screening packages is become very good even. So, looks like now the pattern that I’m seeing is that Q2 is the highest. All those three quarters are very similar. Q1, Q3 and Q4. That’s the observation that I have for last two or three years. Well, let’s see in FY ’24 what happens. [Technical Issues] will not have this whole variable of COVID [Technical Issues] be more it’s. But your observation is right. This time we have not seen a sequential [Technical Issues], which we normally see. And this is not the first time moving even last year also we noticed that.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Tanmay Gandhi — Investec — Analyst,"Okay and sir if we understand that year-on year growth for this year, is not that relevant because of volatile base, but sir if we try to extrapolate our sequential growth, which we have seen during the last four quarters, right, to — to FY ’24 then it roughly translates to mid-to-high single-digit growth. So is that the right way to look at it?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"No, I don’t think it will be. Our estimate is — I know we’ve done 15.5% non-COVID. But it also has four quarters of [Indecipherable] compared two quarters previous year, right. So, the normalized work will be how much for this year? 10% to 11% [Speech Overlap] we definitely hope to follow this year. It won’t be single digit.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Tanmay Gandhi — Investec — Analyst,"Okay and sir, last question on [Technical Issues]. So, we have been saying that largely, it has peaked out and you don’t see any sharp jump from this level right. And historically, our revenue growth was largely driven by outpatient and sample growth but now — but now, but this year, it was also driven by higher realization of our patient. Going forward as we expect some moderation in sort of split expansion, so do you see do you see that again our revenue growth would be driven by volume and — and volume growth has actually come down, right.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, yes, our efforts will always be to drive the volume growth — patient visit growth — not volume patient visit growth and there are various techniques we are using to get better on that count. But as a result of bundling the tests per patient is also moving up significantly, about 11% odd in Q4, and that trend [Technical Issues] further growth. It will reflect in the numbers like interim CFO, is to acquire new customers and service our existing customers in a better fashion.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Tanmay Gandhi — Investec — Analyst,"Understood. And sir, a related question in 4Q, did we have any, did we have any one-off kind of growth in tax-related packages?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,Growth — what did you say?,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Tanmay Gandhi — Investec — Analyst,"Growth in tax-related packages or subset, any one-off growth [Speech Overlap].",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Tax packages, so in the last two-three years. I think Q4 [Technical Issues] picks up because of this tax advantage. This is a normal phenomenon in the base assets. But this year’s growth has been still better than the previous year, led by better distribution, better understanding of our patient’s acceptance, etc. So it is more than tax.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Tanmay Gandhi — Investec — Analyst,Okay got it sir. Thank you. That’s all from my side.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Yogesh Tiwari from Arihant Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Thank you sir, for taking my question. Am I audible? Yes.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Sir, my first question is post COVID. What would be the growth of the in-vitro diagnostic industry.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,In vitro diagnostics?,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Yes, sir.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"Normally IV industry is referred to the reasons suppliers. I presume you’re asking for [Technical Issues] So as I mentioned to you [Technical Issues] which is available in public domain, I just added up, at least for companies data. The last four years, I removed this impact of COVID yield, which is FY ’21 and ’22. The growth rate that I’m seeing is about 10% to 11% CAGR over 4-year or 3-year period. I personally feel that it should sustain. One variable which probably won’t get added because last 4-year CAGR may not have very-high pricing impact, but since our revenues will take price increases. Now coming back, let’s see how the players do but my reading is, it will definitely be in this way going-forward.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"And sir, what would be the total size of the industry, if you can share the thought?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,What will be the total size of the industry?,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,Yes.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"So, there is no published data that we will normally, we refer that these large players contribute about 15% of the value. So, I think one crude better would be [Technical Issues] INR30,000, INR35,000, INR40,000 crores, which is essentially the — the private-label business. When you add this to our hospital lab business, [Technical Issues]. So my sense is to go through INR60,000 crores, something like that. That’s one — one of the ways to look at it.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,This you mentioned this is for the Indian domestic right.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"Yeah, Indian domestic market.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Yogesh Tiwari — Arihant Capital Markets — Analyst,"Okay, sir. That’s very helpful. Thank you very much.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Praveen Kumar from Equitas Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Praveen Kumar — Equitas Capital Advisors — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, thanks for the opportunity. I had a couple of questions. The first question was on comment that Dr. Om has made in his opening remarks. You had mentioned that bundled packages have become a way of life. So just thinking about the comment a little bit more. See as bundled — in terms of bundled packages decision-making point could be perceived to shift to the customer, the patient, instead of the doctor and since the doctor can use this as a major competitive advantage for Dr. Lal, how does — how do you perceive this panning out in terms of your competitive advantage? Yeah, that was my first question.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"Well. I think that’s a great sort of question. My reading, if it was only limited to preventive health checkup, yes decision-making is with consumer or the patient. Since a lot of chronic disease patients also are shifting to bundle packages, we need to actually upgrade this to — these packages [Technical Issues] better value-for-money. So even in U.S. patients also in bundled packages. So, doctor decision-making is still there. Only thing is the doctors also have started prescribing these packages as a part of the normal prescription.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Praveen Kumar — Equitas Capital Advisors — Analyst,"Okay, understood. Thanks for that. I had a second question which was more on the investor presentation, the financials in particular. What I wanted to understand was the company declared normalized — normalized EBITDA margins, whereas a few items are excluded — one of which is the employee stock-compensation or the RSU based compensation. So just wanted to understand the rationale for excluding this. Is it — is it that you perceive these to be more one-off kind of expenses because if not, if you perceive that these are more ongoing nature of competition, best practices, then in one-way or the other the company is bearing the cost for that, right, shouldn’t it be part of overall EBITDA itself? Not a specific normalized EBITDA, yeah. Thank you.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, Praveen, there are two reasons, one is, of course, this is non-cash item, it is not really where the cash outflow from the company’s and second, this charts varies depending on the price of the share because if we are granting ESOP at a time where the price differentiates so probably fluctuates the charts. So, these are the reason why we are showing [Indecipherable].",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Praveen Kumar — Equitas Capital Advisors — Analyst,"But just to understand that, if I look at your past annual reports, and other financial disclosures, this cost has varied between 1% to 1.5% kind of number, right. So just wanted to understand that there is — it seems to vary in that range. So, shouldn’t that be part of this non normalized EBITDA?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Om Prakash Manchanda — Managing Director,"[Indecipherable] you have both the figures in any case, you have a normalized. And you will see EBITDA figures also you can see that. But you’re right. So, there is a, there is a baseline number which will stay here, which could be I think 1% to 1.5% is fairly a good assumption.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Praveen Kumar — Equitas Capital Advisors — Analyst,"Understood, thanks. Thanks for the clarification.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Zaid Munshi from Concept Investwell. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Zaid Munshi — Concept Investwell — Analyst,"Yeah, thank you. Sir, my question is related on the hospital [Technical Issues]. So do we have any plans to expand with partnering with hospitals for the diagnostic part as we don’t disclose the numbers with you know-how many hospitals you have of date.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, we have said in the past that we secured [Indecipherable] we find a very strategic or a geographic fit available to us. Because expanding into a hospital lab management without like a normal retail business can lead to lot of other issues like outstanding debtors and so on. So, it is best to do it with lot of consideration, rather than do it on a mass scale. So, we are selective about the [Indecipherable] we entered in the contracts with, but yes, we do do [Indecipherable].",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Zaid Munshi — Concept Investwell — Analyst,"Okay, so currently I’m main focuses on independent labs, not on hospital labs.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, yeah so. I think that is the main focus. Once in a while we get opportunity we will do [Indecipherable] no problem at all.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Zaid Munshi — Concept Investwell — Analyst,"Okay, okay. Yeah, thank you. That’s it.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sayantan Maji from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Sayantan Maji — Credit Suisse — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. So, my first question is on home sample collection. So, I just wanted to check what are the current trends that you’re seeing after a normalization in — in a post-COVID outbreak. Do you see patients coming back two your centers and the percentage of revenue from home sample collection, has it come down? And what is it currently? How much percentage of our B2C revenues are coming from home sample collection? And what are we in case this is something which is sustaining even after COVID and what are the steps that we’re taking to be competitive versus especially versus the integrated digital health platforms?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, two-three points, one is that during COVID, I think the predominant mode of operation itself was home collection, so the number was very-very high. I think close to 20% percent in those days. But pre-COVID this number of home collection was about 5%. Today, I think what we’re seeing is, let us say, about 8% to 9% of home collection which is a better trend than what we had in the pre-COVID bids, but significantly down obviously from the COVID days. So that is one-way to look at the numbers.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Breaking this, underlying thing is about the patients choosing a lab of trust. It is all about convenience, convenience is one of the various factors involved in it, but they want to look at lab of — lab etc., and we continue to enjoy a very trusted position, a very favored position on this count. So, we are seeing home collection revenues in-line with this thought of us.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Sayantan Maji — Credit Suisse — Analyst,"Okay, and this 8% to 9% is of B2C, or of the total revenue?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,Of I think the total revenues.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Sayantan Maji — Credit Suisse — Analyst,"Of total revenue, okay. And in the deck, you have mentioned of variable model. Can you just explain it to, let’s say, mid, like what is this variable model which grows in business volume?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"When did we speak about variable model, sorry, if I [Speech Overlap]",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Sayantan Maji — Credit Suisse — Analyst,"So, in slide number 25 of the investor deck, it says that in the home collection slide you said it is a variable model, which grows [Speech Overlap]",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Okay, okay, okay, okay, Ved you want to take this?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Ved Prakash Goel — Group Chief Financial Officer,"So Sayantan this is — this is one-way of hiring people, which is fixed pay, and another way is the lab pickup. You pay as per pickup. So, it is not a fixed charge, like you have — our own center versus franchisee center. It is similar to that, like, we instead of hiring people or giving fixed contract, it is per pickup based payment.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Sayantan Maji — Credit Suisse — Analyst,"Okay, so basically the salary of the phlebotomist is entirely dependent on the number of samples, he or she picks up in a day.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, you are right.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Sayantan Maji — Credit Suisse — Analyst,"Okay, got it. Sure and just second question is bookkeeping one. So now that you know FY ’23 is over so what was the total [Indecipherable] impact on EBITDA [Indecipherable] benefit to EBITDA?",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"So, it is about 2.5% roughly, which is on account of [Indecipherable].",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Sayantan Maji — Credit Suisse — Analyst,"Okay sure. Okay, thank you for taking my questions. All the best.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,Thank you.,LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that would be our last question for today. I now hand the conference back to the management for their closing remarks. Thank you and over to you.",LALPATHLAB,Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd 
Bharath Uppiliappan — Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you everyone for being with us on this call today. I hope we were unable to address your queries.

Sameer Bhise — JM Financial — Analyst,"Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the 4Q 2023 Earnings Conference Call of MAS Financial Services. First of all. I would like to thank the management of the company, Mr. Kamlesh Gandhi for giving us the opportunity to host this call. From the management side today we have Mr. Kamlesh Gandhi, Chairman and Managing Director; Mrs. Darshana Pandya, Director and CEO; Mr. Ankit Jain, the Chief Financial Officer and entire senior management team of the company.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Sameer Bhise — JM Financial — Analyst,"We will first begin with opening comments from Mr. Gandhi regarding the business environment and then we proceed to the Q&A session. Over to you, sir. Thank you.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Thank you so much and good evening everybody. I’m happy to be connected again, for sharing the Q4 performance of the company. I have shared with all of you I think the press release and our presentation on the website. The performance of the company was very robust and in lines with our two decades of performance what we have demonstrated over all these 25 years of working. And this was the first full uninterrupted year of working post COVID. And taking that into account, the performance of the company in terms of AUM and PAT and in terms of growth stands at 29.55% in AUM and 27.5% in profit f you look at the performance for the whole year. And if you say the quality of the assets has been pristine at net Stage 3 asset at around 1.52%.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"One more achievement or one more milestone what we’re crossed this year is crossing a consolidated profit about INR200 crores. The consolidated profit is approximately INR206 crores of the company, which I consider is an important milestone. And we are striking distance away from a very another important milestone. We are very confident of achieving it this year is of reaching and crossing INR10,000 crores in AUM.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Recollect the INR1,000 crores once done in ’12, ’13. And if you take the year-one year out of COVID, so in a decade we have grown this book 10 times. So if were 1,000 crores, a growth of ’12, ’13, and we are [Indecipherable] of crossing INR10,000 crores. In ’23, 24, which translates into almost a 25% CAGR over a long period of 10 years and I think all of you will agree that this was a very-very eventful decade, starting — If you take into account the various crisis in the financial sector and the last one, but not the least, the health crisis which has devastated not only India but the whole world.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So I’m very happy to share despite of all these cycles, the company to demonstrate a 25% CAGR and 10 times growth. And we have very strong enablers for the same even going-forward in terms of capital adequacy, in terms of the expertise, in terms of prioritizing in quality profitability over just growth, giving us not the growth but the development. And once again INR10,000 crores will be a milestone which I think will once again fade away it faded away in memory. And as I articulated in our communication, that every time we reach a milestone [Indecipherable]",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So this was the achievement on the company as a whole while my colleagues Darshana and Ankit will l take you in detail. But just on the strategic front, I’ll come on the distribution side that dedication, that is creation of the asset. We continue to focus on the MSME segment which constitutes more than 80% of our business. We have the potentiality to serve more than 9,000 centers across the country and our focus will remain on MSME segment towards adding distribution and through very robust NBFC distribution channel also.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"The distribution model to NBFC also witnessed a very strong performance, a 11.5, almost 12 years-old module now with a cumulative disbursement of more than INR20,000 crores and now given the default of less than a percentage, as demonstrated a very high-quality intermediation. So we’ll continue to — we will continue to strengthen our distribution for the asset creation on both the distribution network. Having said that, our direct distribution network is fast increasing in terms of percentage and contribution. This year it is contributing 63% and will continue to contribute more going forward.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"We all know that technology plays a very important role and so we are aware and working very hard on that through our internal team of more than around 35, 40 people are working hard to say to that how we address the technology that increases the efficiencies, right from loan origination to disbursement banking to transaction, and I think that will add to that going forward.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"I would like to inform all of you which was I think shared on our website also, but I’m very happy to inform that we have formed a Management Advisory Committee and Advisory Committee to the Board consisting of three eminent people, starting from Dr Rajiv Kumar, who was the ex EPRO Vice Chairman and renowned the economist, recently being conferred upon by one of the highest award by the government of Japan for his contribution towards infrastructure during his tenure his his tenure as EPRO Vice Chairman. I think his insight will provide lot of research to the company for his next growth of INR10,000 crores then beyond.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"The second Eminent person is TTS Srinivas Raghavan, the ex MD Sundaram Finance. In our NBFC sector is known as the father of the NBFC industry, having demonstrated a very quality pristine growth over many years and a stalwart of industry and. Mr. Paliwal, the ex ED and the current CEO of small finance banks association. So I think I’m very thankful to all the three eminent personality for having very readily agreed to join the Advisory Board and I am confident that they will contribute very positively as as we scale new heights and horizon of of10,000 crores and beyond.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"On the HR side, we continue to remain a strong team of 2,500 people and I’m very proud to share that there is a minimum attrition at the top and the median level. As I’ve always said that we are very strong team — core team of more than 35 to 40 people who are bringing this inception. So we have filled and launched collectively and that has put the company in a very good stead, along with our focus on lateral recruitment also going forward. But that was on the HR side.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So from me, just to reiterate that it was a very robust and a strong quarter. We see very strong enablers for us to continue our growth anywhere between 20% to 25% going-forward and crossing an important milestone of INR10,000 crores this year with keeping fundamentals intact. If you have to look at our capital adequacy is more than 25% and 21% as Tier 1 capital and it is very important to mention here that post our IPO raised almost five years from close to INR3,000 crores will be almost INR10,000 crores this year mainly through internal accruals and I understand all of you will agree that in the lending business where capital leads the way and growing through internal accruals that too with strong capital adequacy, speaks of the robustness of the operations and the asset creation.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"I’m happy to share that we have declared a dividend of 18.5%, the final dividend, that is the dividend for the whole year to 36.5% which amounts to 10% of the payout of the current year PAT, in lines with our strategy which have been followed since last few years.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So with this, I would like to hand over to Darshana to take you through the numbers in detail while the numbers are with you, but just to refresh she will take you through the numbers in detail, which are important for all of us to understand.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Darshana Pandya — Director and CEO,"Good afternoon, everyone. I’m happy to share the numbers for Q4 23 and financial year ’22, ’23. And as mentioned back, post COVID this was the full-year which was without any abnormal situation. So we could do other book by 29.55%. And if we look at the configuration of the portfolio, micro enterprise loan is now at INR3,874 crores as compared to INR3,249 crores, this is 19.23% growth. SME loan has grown by 31.29% from INR2,274 crores to almost INR3,000 crores. Two-wheeler loan have grown by 46.88%, which is now INR554 crores as compared to INR377 crore last year. Commercial vehicle loan has grown by 7.90% from INR3,45 crores to INR372 crores. As such, we have grown our retail book in our commercial vehicle vehicle loan portfolio, but there are few instances of pre-closure in our NBFC book and hence the percentage is 7.90% crores. Sor SPL loans, It’s a new segment for this year. So we don’t have any comparative figures. The book size is now INR305 crores.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Darshana Pandya — Director and CEO,"If we look at the total income on quarterly basis it has grown by 47.3% from INR183 crores to INR270 crores. Profit before-tax has grown by 17.37% from INR60 crores to INR70 crores. Profit after on quarterly basis has grown by 23.44% from INR45 crores to INR55 crores. And if you look at the annual numbers, total income has grown by 44.44% from crores657 crores to crores949 crores. PBT has increased by 25.27% from INR211 crores to INR264 crores, and profit after tax has grown by 27.5% from INR157 crores to INR200 crores. I’m happy to share that we could maintain the quality of the portfolio. So now our gross Stage 3 asset is 2.15 and Stage 3 asset is is 1.52% as compared to 2.33% gross Stage 3 and 1.60% net Stage as on December ’22. 4.31% off of our total on Book asset as management overlay.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd

Total income has grown by 34.33% from INR9 crores to INR12.40 cores. Profit before-tax has come down by 9.28% from 1 crore 87 lakhs to to 1 crores 70 lakhs. That is mainly because of increasing in our operating expenditure because we have expanded our branch network and accordingly the number of employees have also increased.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Darshana Pandya — Director and CEO,"Profit after tax has come down by 8.62%, 1 crore 50 lakhs to 1 crore 37 lakhs. And if you look at the annual numbers, total income has grown by 20.6% from INR36 crores to INR43 crores. PBT has increased by 20% from INR6 crores to INR8 crores. And PAT increased by 29.66% from INR4 crore 89 lakhs to 6 crore 34 lakhs..",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Darshana Pandya — Director and CEO,So this was regarding the performance of both the companies. Now I’ll request Ankit to take you through the liability management.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So before Ankit Jain joins, I missed out on apprising all of you on housing finance. As I always shared with you that housing finance is going to be one of a strong value accretion for the company going-forward. And that also we have registered a 30% growth and this year we also anticipate a 32%, 35% growth. We see this company growing to INR1,000 crores within next year or two and generating value for the company going-forward. So we are happy to share that we are confident about our growth in our housing finance company also, that remains the quality of the asset I shared at around 0.6% of net Stage 3 asset and any growth capital can be contributed whenever required.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So with all the strong enablers of large market size this expertise being developed and gaining the traction in terms of business line, we are sure that the housing finance will register a robust growth this year.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"With this, I’d like to hand over to Ankit Jain to appraise on the liability side.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"Level. Yeah, thank you sir and ma’am. Hello to all. To elaborate on the the liability management. So this quarter we were able to maintain a liquidity buffer of around of INR650 to INR700 crores and along with that unused liability of around INR375 crores. In addition, the company have sanctioned on-hand to various instrument of more than liability250 crores.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"In the last quarter, company did around the liability 555 crores direct assignment transaction with various bank. And we have further have a INR1,000 crore sanctioned on-hand which gives you till the the next two quarters. The last quarter, company did around INR24 crores co-lending. transaction. The company has tied-up with three banks and we are in discussion with few other banks for equal and sustainable co-lending tier. We aim to maintain around 20% to 25% of AUM as of book through direct assignment and co-lending transactions. We have cash credit facility of around INR1,700 crores, out of which the utilization generally remains around 65% to 70%. And this portion is always kept as a liquidity buffer",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"We successfully rolled over around INR40 crores and INR50 crores soft term working capital loans which are sub limit of these cash credit limit. With this, INR755 crores term-loan during the quarter. This term-loan is generally for a tenure of three to five years, which help us to further strengthen the asset-liability maturity pattern. Our structure liquidity is strong, whereby there is no negative impact on liquidity and the cash flow in all the cumulative bucket remain positive.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"On the capital adequacy side, we have remained strong at 25.25%, with Tier 1 capital of 20.79% and debt-equity of around 4 times this year. In the March quarter, we raised around INR100 crores of subordinate debt which qualifies as Tier 2 capital and help us to further strengthen the base of capital structure. The cost and borrowings for the quarter was around 9.26% and for the whole year it was around 9.02%. This is majorly because of our efforts towards cost reduction which we raised funds through various instrument and from various institutes as well as because of the lag effect of MCLR based borrowing. We see that this cost of borrowing to settle around 9.5% in the coming quarters. So, this is on the capital liability management, and we are open for the Q&A round. Thank you.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Jain — Chief Financial Officer,Questions and Answers:,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Rahul Jain from Credence Wealth.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Credence Wealth — Analyst,"So, three questions. One, with the cost of funds having gone up and also competition going up on the MSME side, which is one of the areas where our focus has been and which has been doing well for us. So how do we see the scenario ahead both in terms of growth and also with terms of whether we will continue to grow aggressively in this particular segment, how do we look at this segment? That is question number one.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Credence Wealth — Analyst,"Second is — shall I ask all the questions, or shall I go one by one?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,You may carry you on. You can ask all the questions.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Credence Wealth — Analyst,"Okay. Second is with regards to the NIMs, again, with the cost of fund up and now it’s almost about 4 quarters for the fund, costs have gone up. And we have been able to pass on certain part of it, but how do we see the scenario going ahead in terms of maintaining our NIMs?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Credence Wealth — Analyst,"Lastly, the salaried personal loan segment we have done exceptionally well in last one year, practically from nothing, we today have almost INR300 crores AUM in that particular segment. So, two things, do we still feel that the kind of aggressive growth which we have done in this segment will continue with that on this base of INR300 crores? And since this is our first experience with this segment, how do we see the asset quality for this particular asset class? Thank you.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So, starting from the first question, I’ll club two questions on rate, cost of funds and NIMs. So, if you see last year, as Ankit shared, that because of our immaculate track record with various lenders, we are in a position to negotiate to talk with them on the premium which they charge on MCLR and hence we are in a position to maintain NIMs during the most volatile period of close to 7%. As we go forward, right from the last year, we had endeavored to start repricing our assets accordingly. And now with the rate cycles being — the hikes being paused. But nevertheless, being MCLR link, there will be some rate hikes being passed on to us. As Ankit told that from the marginal cost of 9.25% we might see a 9.5% this quarter. But still with the repricing and with a better negotiation with the lenders, we are confident of maintaining NIMs anywhere between 6.75% to 7% as maintained over the years during this year also.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"On the MSME growth, please let me share with you two basic things here, that this is a very, very huge market to be served one. So, the competitive landscape does not put that stress on the rate. It is not about getting the market size. If I talk about what is my market share in MSME, it will be difficult for me to give any number in an integer. It is a fraction and so less that can’t be calculated. So, the size of the market is so huge. And secondly, it is not rate considered to that extent at 0.5% or 0.25% will play a very important role in getting the assets the way we want. This has",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Been our experience over all these years, and wherever we have seen the cycles of higher rate, higher inflation, or various other headwind, we have been in position to understand the segment nicely and navigate through that. So that was on your MSME piece on the growth and the rate and the",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,NIMs.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"On the salaried personal loans, this a INR300 crores as a total of, close to INR8,100 crores of AUM is around 4% of our total AUM. And we would, as I say, remarked by you, we will grow cautiously. Any new product which will pick up, we don’t grow very aggressively. But at the same time, we need some critical mass to assess the product performance. And we think that this was a critical mass we need to build up to get the product performance. And we’ll be building up on this, depending upon our experience we have from time to time on the asset quality and the learnings and unlearning that we have to undertake. But having said that, as a strategy, salaried personal loans will not be more than 5% to 7% of our total AUM for next few years, this is is what I envisage right now unless it starts exhibiting excellent risk-adjusted returns. So, this is my response to all the three questions you asked.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Credence Wealth — Analyst,"Just a clarification or just added thing to the overall MSME, SME and two-wheelers. Given the high interest rates today, you are comfortable at today’s rates to lend and grow at around 25%? Because generally our principles or we have always maintained that we will grow, but we will always grow profitably. So, given the high rate of interest, you will maintain that growth rate of around 25% in spite of maybe sometimes getting concerned about the asset quality?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"See, our rate hike is what are we talking about? We are talking about a rate hike of around 0.25% or 0.3% to be passed on to the borrowers. I think that is not going to affect the quality. And secondly, let me tell you that we have passed through various cycles where the rates were much higher initially for the same segment. But still we have managed the good asset quality within those rate brackets also. So, this marginal rate hike I don’t recon can have any impact on the asset quality.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"At the same time see, in lending rate whatever rate you lend, you have to be cautious and you need to understand that you have to be very circumspect on the credit underwriting. So today only I shared with one of the channels that while we would like to determine growth, but at the",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Same time we don’t mind discovering the growth at the ground level. So, I always give a range bound growth target between 20% to 25%. You might overshoot it if we get a s in fact a good opportunity as we did this year to register 29% growth.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Rahul Jain — Credence Wealth — Analyst,Sure. Thank you so much sir and all the best. Thank you.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Next question is from the line of Jaiprakash Toshniwal from LIC Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Jaiprakash Toshniwal — LIC Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Good afternoon, sir. Thank you. Sir, can you just more elaborate on the Corporate Advisory Committee in terms of what is the term of the committee? How many times it will meet up in the year and what is the scope?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So, the term of the committee is — it will be renewed every year and the scope is more on strategic in nature, understanding the company’s strategic intent and looking at our all the execution parameters, advising us on what best can be done to align our execution in lines of strategic intent at the company administrators. And secondly, they will be very helpful in understanding in giving their reasons that what exactly are we supposed to do as we grow in scale. And advising on any matter which is sought, which is referred to them in terms of increasing the efficiencies or in terms of any recovery phase during our execution. So, we have taken the committee members from the varied sources. That is one an economist and another person who has run the NBFC at a scale for a very long time and the one from the regulatory aspect. So, when guiding us from the regulatory aspect will be useful by one of the committee members who happens to be the ex-Executive Director of RBI. So, it will meet four times a year. We will meet every quarter, post our results at the mutual convenience of the Board members and the committee members, but not limited to four times. It can increase on demand whenever it is required.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Jaiprakash Toshniwal — LIC Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Okay. Interesting. Thanks. The second question on the personal loan segment. You mentioned that you have reached through a critical mass at this point of time. So does it mean that you have some more data on the customer or how the product has performed, anything which you want to highlight on this product per se? See, it’s really early to know the trends because this was the first year of the critical mass. And as the time progresses, we’ll be in a position to understand that. And hence, that is what I was referring to that we’ll be watching the portfolio this year very closely. But as of now, the portfolio has been satisfactory, while we learn every month on what has to be amended in terms of our credit screens from the early bounces and all what we see. But currently, it’s difficult to talk About the trend of the portfolio. But we are very circumspect ab initio and we’d like to be there for as long as we have sufficient experience and data to scale up to a certain time. So currently, the portfolio quality is good, and it is quite satisfactory. But going ahead, we’ll have to see that have it the year over a period of time. Okay. And sir, just last question we’re planning to have our own feet on the street and on branches to cater to the MSME segment? So can you just elaborate more where are we on that journey? And how much — what is the target for the FY ’24 for that journey perspective?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So, I’ll break this into two. So, we are rather slightly shifting our focus to the SME piece, whereas micro-enterprise loans we have been doing it since many years, and this is being distributed through our NBFC partners also. But on the SME piece, we intend to have specialized branches in the country where thereby we will be having close to 50 branches in total, where they will be distributing only SME loans. And there will be fleet on street being employed and will be close to around 350 to 400 guys working there in various capacities in the origination, credit and collections. That will be the total addition to this segment. And the ticket size will range anywhere between around INR22 lakhs to INR25 lakhs.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"And secondly, in this part of the business, we are happy to share that because of the technological advancement, the credit assessment has relatively become more accurate. And at the same time, the turnaround time has also reduced. If I give an example, we are in a position and we finance to the SME where we have access to direct GST data and their banking data and the credit score, we get from time to time. So, it helps us to gauge their cash flows, their income, their credit history.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"And so far, our experience has been very good on early delinquencies as far as this segment is concerned. While we’ll continue to do the other ways, we have been doing so far.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Jaiprakash Toshniwal — LIC Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Okay. Thanks. I’ll come back in the queue, sir. Thank you.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] Next question is from the line of Ankit Gupta from Bamboo Capital Partners. Please go ahead.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Thanks for the opportunity and congratulations for a good set of numbers for the entire year. So, sir, I wanted to ask about the measures that we are taking to improve our cost of borrowing. With our size growing and our direct presence also increasing, how do you think we can get a lower rate of borrowing? And I",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Think that will also come from upgrading ratings as well. So, your views on reducing the cost of borrowing and measures you are taking to do that?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So, reducing cost of borrowing is a very continuous exercise. So we always try to get the liability at the cheapest available rates while keeping one eye on that amount we need to raise. So given our track record, let me tell you that we are rated A+ by CARE and AA minus by ACUITE. I can’t predict for rating agencies. But fundamentally, we are almost there for our rating upgrade. But we just need to wait and watch the credit rating perspective. So, we continuously try to see to that how we reduce the fund through a variety of resources and keeping the powder dry for at least 2x or 3x the amount we need. So, what happens in liability, your capabilities to reject an offer is very important for getting the right rate. And how far are you placed in terms of the timing. Let me share with you that we are always 2 to 3 quarters ahead in terms of sanctions. As Ankit told you, we already have more than INR1,200 crores of sanctions in various forms, which is more than sufficient for our Q1, and by Q1 we’ll be having another sanction will be okay for us until Q3. So being ahead of the curve in terms of requirements and having more sanctions on hand, having diversified source of funds in terms of say, for example, we have cash credit limit carved out to",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Demand term loans. We have term loans. We have term loans from PSUs, private banks, developmental financial institutes, then we have capital market borrowings also up till now it was through MLD now it will be through NCDs. And we have assignments and PTC can also be drawn. So, the various sources of funds being ahead of the curve, keeping the powder dry for more amount and then choosing and taking the right offers is the key. So, it is all about execution.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Sure. But just if you look at it, our bank borrowings largely term loan and cash credit, which consumed around 68% of our total borrowing. And last year also, if you look at it, as of March 31, 2022, the amount was around — the proportion was around 68%. And so — like do you think when we grow to, let’s say, INR15,000 crores, INR20,000 crores kind of over the next three to five years. The proportion of bank borrowing will come down. And hopefully, by the time we will be upgraded to AA category are the proportions of NCDs and CPs and our ability to access the bond market will also increase? And like what are our plans for that?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Definitely. See once again it’s a question of size. At a particular size, diversification beyond a particular extent is not possible. So, for example, I want a term loan and whereas State Bank of India telling me that, okay. I’m very happy that you are working, you will have to get a sanction from us of INR500 crores. There, I cannot go and tell that no I want a diversification and I’m not going to use this resource. So, to the maximum extent possible practically, we have diversified. And as we grow automatically, we’ll get the room to diversify because what happens is that while we need money, even bankers have a target to lend to good companies and good parties. So, if you see, during the quarter end, my finance team is hard pressurized for taking the disbursement of the various sanctions on hand. And it is difficult to convince all of them for it to delay to the next quarter or to some of them, we might have to dismiss them by not taking it. So, diversification will definitely happen, which will happen with size and as you rightly remarked, this increase in rating all sorts of diversified resources will be explored. And that will help to reduce the cost also.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Really asking, let’s say, if you have to access the bond market now for a three- to five-year kind of NCD plain vanilla NCDs, and compare that with a three- to five-year term loan, like what kind of cost advantage do we get when we access the bond market — when we are accessing the bond market currently?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,I think my understanding is that the bond market will be at least 0.5% to 0.7% higher as compared to the term loans we raised because of the various costs involved in raising those.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Sure. Sure. And I think that difference will actually become negative, or bond market might become cheaper for you when you — growing size and hopefully get a rating upgrade to AA category?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Yes, yes, yes.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Okay. Sir, my second question was on the branches. If you look at our branches that we have opened in last year, so the major branch expansion has come through our existing states where we had a larger presence like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. And some of the newer places like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Chhattisgarh we just entered. So those haven’t seen much of expansion. So, what kind of opportunity size is a label in our existing areas, like three, four states where we have larger presence? And what are plans for geographical expansions in the new states that we have entered? And any plans to enter further new states in FY ’24 to ’25?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"See, it is all about the intention of the company to grow in a particular center where we have stated afresh. So, all the new branches will start gaining in disbursements over a period of time once we have the experience, the right team, the right understanding, demographic understanding, which only comes through working. So, with all our new branches being opened at various states, we’ll start gaining in traction this year. And we would like to be ahead by",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Around two to three quarters in terms of our requirement of assets when you open new branches. So that is where I told you — shared with all of you in the opening remarks that we contemplate to have more than around 175 branches this year, up from 150 branches. That is to say with our requirement not only for this year but up to Q1 or Q2 for the next year, as I see right now. Then later on during the year, as the year progresses, it can increase or decrease depending upon the asset what we can create. But at the same time, let me tell you that we are keen to expand our distribution, which can be done any time. But the distribution will be done in such a manner whereby the quality of the assets and the risk adjusted returns are maintained. So keeping all these things, we’ll be expanding to newer geographies, newer branches, which is always available to us.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Operator,"Thank you. Ankit, sorry to interrupt you. I’ll ask you to come back in the question queue for a follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Hardik Doshi from White Whale Partners. Please go ahead.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Hardik Doshi — White Whale Partners — Analyst,"Thank you for taking my question. My first question was on the housing finance side, the gross NPAs for the stage 3 assets have been inching up over the last four quarters or so. Anything on the asset quality side that we should be aware of? Or how is the delinquency rate over the last few quarters?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"See, it has to be a range bound. And as we grow, if I share with you on certain book size to keep delinquencies up to a certain level if possible. But as we grow, it will be range bound, but within acceptable levels. If I share with you the acceptable levels in affordable housing is anything less than 2%. But we are currently at around 0.62%. And as we grow, I think it will marginally increase. But it will be in sync with our planning in the strategic intent on the price structure that",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Is the ROE tree, what you call it. And currently, in the current portfolio, there is nothing which we should worry about. Because if you see the performance in terms of the net Stage 3 assets, it’s pretty robust as compared to the industry standard. So, we can expect a range bound the net Stage 3 assets, which",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Should be less than a 1% up to the INR500 crores, INR1,000 crores, and it can do between 1% to 2% as we grow above that.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Hardik Doshi — White Whale Partners — Analyst,"Got it. Okay. And in terms of the loan book, you said it’s up to INR5 million in residential and INR10 million in commercial. So, the profile of these customers, do they overlap a lot with our SME lenders? I mean, I’m just trying to understand how much of cross-selling opportunities there? Or is this a very independent base?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"See, currently, it’s a very independent base because while we might get an opportunity, the problem will be on the eligibility because as a lender, how I would like to go beyond an exposure on a particular party is very important. So, in our class of the borrowers, the loans usually are sequential in nature that you complete one loan and then takes another loan or has completed a major portion of the first loan and then goes for the second loan. So, the cross-sell is always available to us. But once they complete one side of a loan or they complete one side of the loan substantially. So, it has to be looked from that aspect. And if I share with you currently, our cross-sell percentage is not that great. And that is only because of the limitations on the credit faces on extending more loans or fresh loans to them.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Hardik Doshi — White Whale Partners — Analyst,"Okay. Understood. And while we give loans of up to INR50 lakh, what is our average ticket size? And what is the mix between residential and commercial? And who are our main competitors out here? I’m guessing this we are doing mainly in Gujarat right now.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"On housing, average ticket size is INR700,000 currently. And you are right that we doing in Gujarat. The next is Maharashtra. And we also started exploring Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. So, the ticket size will be around INR700,000.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Darshana Pandya — Director and CEO,And our housing portfolio is around 82%.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Hardik Doshi — White Whale Partners — Analyst,Okay. And the 18% commercial is mainly a LAP?,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Darshana Pandya — Director and CEO,"So, 16% is commercial and around 3% is project funding. And the non-housing, commercial part is both LAP and loans to purchase the shops and/or commercial property.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Hardik Doshi — White Whale Partners — Analyst,Okay. And our breakup between salaried and non-salaried?,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Darshana Pandya — Director and CEO,"So right now, we are not having those numbers with us, we can share it offline.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Hardik Doshi — White Whale Partners — Analyst,"Got it. Okay. Just one last question on the main book. Our opex ratio had gone up significantly last year as we invested into the branches. But now it seems to have kind of it seems to be picking out. So, can we expect like some kind of leverage maybe next year as we get more efficiency and scale-up on the new branches that we started in FY ’23?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Yes, definitely. But from the branches, which has already been opened this year or last year, will definitely gain on critical mass and we’ll add on to reducing our opex. But at the same time, we will be opening up new branches. So as long as we are in that cycle of opening more and more branches, but I think opex might increase a little bit. But overall, on an AUM basis, what we will strive to do is that we’ll try to keep the net ROA anywhere between 2.75% to 3% and plan our activities accordingly.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Hardik Doshi — White Whale Partners — Analyst,Okay. Got it. All right. Great. Thanks so much.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,Thank you.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Pratik Pai from ICICI Bank. Please go ahead.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Pratik Pai — ICICI — Analyst,"Yeah, I wanted to understand what would the asset quality going forward? What’s the guidance on that?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"I think as of now, we are confident to maintain a sub-2% level as far as net stage-3 assets are concerned.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Pratik Pai — ICICI — Analyst,And what about gross? How much would be the gross?,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,It will be range bound. Net will be anywhere between 1.5% to 2%. Gross can be in between 2.25% to 2.75%.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Pratik Pai — ICICI — Analyst,"Okay, thank you.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. The next follow-up question is from the line of Jaiprakash Toshniwal from LIC Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Jaiprakash Toshniwal — LIC Mutual Fund — Analyst,"Hi sir, thanks. Sir, on my earlier questions about SME branch, you mentioned that you’re opening 50 branches. What is the timeframe for these 50 branches?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"I think 50 will be in total. We already have around 20 branches at place. So out of that, 30 new will be opened. And I think most of them will be opened this year or latest by Q1 next year.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Jaiprakash Toshniwal — LIC Mutual Fund — Analyst,Okay. Thank you.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Sanjay Ladha from Bastion Research. Please go ahead.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Sanjay Ladha — Bastion Research — Analyst,"Hello. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity. So, I have a couple of questions. First is our sourcing intermediaries which used to be 372 in CV",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Sanjay Ladha — Bastion Research — Analyst,And 312 in 2-wheeler in FY ’22 have reduced to 268 and 242 in FY ’23. How should we read this? And any color on that side?,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Darshana Pandya — Director and CEO,Number of partners you are talking about?,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Sanjay Ladha — Bastion Research — Analyst,Yes. The sourcing intermediaries partner.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So that sourcing — let me tell you who are the sourcing intermediary partners. When you talk about CV intermediary partners, we are mainly into dealing with brokers who have helped us to source, and they also have stock of new vehicles. So that is a very dynamic thing. As we grow, it can increase and decrease depending upon the assessment of the intermediaries we do from time to time.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Sanjay Ladha — Bastion Research — Analyst,"Okay. And my next question would be about 31 to 60 DPD has increased quarter-on-quarter from 0.7% to 1.1%. And in this quarter, our credit cost has increased. So, what is the outlook for full year or any guidance on that side? And how should we look at? Thank you.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"If you see overall quality of the assets, what we concentrate is on maintaining at least 90% plus on current and then if you see the focus on the 90 DPD, which has been well maintained. Within the bucket, the percentage may vary, and it will vary as we go ahead. But in terms of the credit cost, as we said, our credit cost is anywhere close to 1% next year.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Sanjay Ladha — Bastion Research — Analyst,Okay. Thank you.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question is from the line of Prit from Wealth Finvisor. Please go ahead.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Prit — Wealth Finvisor — Analyst,"Good afternoon, everyone. One aspect I wanted to understand, Kamlesh bhai was related to the digitization that’s going on and how that can be a threat to in terms of MAS in terms of how banks can go after the kind of segment that you are into say, similar to what happened with gold loans. So what is your sense on",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Prit — Wealth Finvisor — Analyst,"That? I understand the market is large, but at the same time, there will be a set of borrowers that you are interested in. Would increase in digitization make it easier for others to also get to that same set of borrowers?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Sir, just to answer your question in two parts. If it’s digitization, we are also in the process of adopting and will adopt the digitization to the maximum level possible to serve our class of the borrowers. So, it will not be an added advantage to any other lenders, and we don’t have that. And secondly, digitization has limitations in our type of borrowers if you want to control the credit cost. Because when you talk about digitization, let’s say, take you to the three basic aspects of digitization mainly sourcing, the credit decisioning and transaction. And most importantly, if you talk about MAS, we are already there in terms of sourcing",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Internally because digitization is a two-way traffic, the borrower should also be well versed. And in terms of transaction right from day one, we are a banking-based disbursement and banking-based collection. So, what it comes to the point and voice down to credit decisioning. But on credit decisioning if you take digitization an as aid to manual credit decisioning or as an alternative to manual credit decisioning is the point of debate. And when it comes to the point",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"When credit decisioning is taken as an alternate to human credit decisioning, the portfolio quality for across the fintechs has not been that great. And I’m afraid that it’s a very long-term journey. If I talk about one of the quotes of Amazon Chairman, he said that digitization and AI, the overnight in AI is 10 years. So, to replace human intervention in credit decisioning altogether, I think, can be done, but it comes at a cost, which the lenders cannot afford as of now. So as an",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Aid to credit decisioning, we’re already using it. So, in terms of we have a number of apps with API provider. We have a number of API tie-ups; we use account aggregators.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"So, to summarize, to drive the point of, we will not be working at a disadvantage position on digitization. So, we’ll be at par as to what the best practices can be in terms of sourcing this and serving this sector.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Prit — Wealth Finvisor — Analyst,"Right. So, what I was trying to get to Kamlesh bhai is that the banks, for example, right, will also have the ability to do exactly what you guys are doing with more digitization available or more aggregators available. So, do you see any kind of increase in competition from them similar to say what happens in gold loans?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"I think as far as the type of the segment we serve; it is concerned once again the huge market size. And number second is that it’s not only one lender can satisfy the borrower’s requirement. And not only one lender would like to take the complete risk on a singular borrower. So, competition from the bank has been since long, the customers who we are serving already have banking relationships with more than one, two, three banks. But every lender comes with its own expertise and every lender has a limited appetite for risk on a particular borrower. So, with this practical aspect, every lender finds a place in the borrower’s liability management. Provided you give better services, provided you understand this segment better. The problem in this segment is not how much asset you can create. The problem in this segment is that what quality of assets you can create, that is the biggest problem. So as long as you can focus on quality, the size of asset is never going to be a problem for any other members.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Prit — Wealth Finvisor — Analyst,"My second question is regarding that you had mentioned in your past calls that you borrow at MCLR, right? Is my understanding correct?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,We borrow at MCLR-based borrowing.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Jain — Chief Financial Officer,"So usually when it is a long-term loan, it will be linked to 1-year MCLR.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Prit — Wealth Finvisor — Analyst,"That’s correct. So, my question is that when the rate card — when the rates start reversing, does that put us at a disadvantage?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"Yes. So that is what Ankit was alluding to that marginal cost of borrowing 9.25% might increase to 9.5% as that reset happens. But at that point of time, we would have the advantage of having time to reprice our assets and also to negotiate hard with the bank on the premium they charge on MCLR. And that is where combination of our negotiation with the banks on lending rates and the negotiations with the borrowers on the lending rates and with the lenders on the borrowing rate, we think we will be in a position to maintain our NIMs as we demonstrated last year.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Prit — Wealth Finvisor — Analyst,Thank you so much Kamlesh bhai. All the best.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,Thank you.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Operator,Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ankit Gupta from Bamboo Capital Partners. Please go ahead.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Thanks for the follow-up. Kamlesh bhai, if you can give some guidance on how do you think — how do you see the NIMs panning out for us for FY ’24? Hopefully, the interest rates have topped out. And by now, we shouldn’t see further increase in the rates. So, what are your views on our NIM trajectory for FY",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,’24?,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"I think it’s time for anywhere between 6.75% to 7%. As you see this year, we maintained 7%, and we are confident of being very close to that.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,"Sure. So, some compression that we have seen in Q3 and Q4 of this year, we think we should be able to reverse that hopefully by Q2, Q3 of next financial year?",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Kamlesh Gandhi — MAS Financial Services Ltd,"When I talk about range 6.75% to 7%, this includes everything that initially might be a little lower and then we pick up as we go ahead. And we’ll be working on repricing our assets also and at the same time we’ll be working on how to be more efficient on operations.",MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd 
Ankit Gupta — Bamboo Capital Partners — Analyst,Sure. Thank you very much.,MASFIN,MAS Financial Services Ltd

Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,Questions and Answers:,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Operator,"Thank you, very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen we will wait for a moment while the question queue assembles. The first question is from the line of Balaji Prasad from Barclays. Please go ahead.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Mikhaila — Barclays — Analyst,"Hi, this is the Mikhaila [Phonetic] on for Balaji. Thanks for taking our question. Just wondering if you could provide a bit more detail around the deal with [Technical Issues] discussing what responsibilities will look like on both. And just what really convinced you about their asset and its potential. Thanks.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
G V Prasad — Co-Chairman and Managing Director,"Balaji, we were not able to hear you. Well, I’m afraid you’ll have to repeat the question, can you repeat please.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Mikhaila — Barclays — Analyst,"Sure, sure. Is this better. Can you hear me better now. Yes please. Okay, hi this is Mikhaila on for Balaji. Thank you for taking our question. We’re just wondering if you could provide a bit more detail around your deal with [Indecipherable] just discussing what responsibilities will look like on both ends. And also just wondering what convinced you about this [Technical Issues] asset and its potential. Thanks.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"No, thank you. So, strategically, we are looking for unmet needs, especially in India. And we believe that we are in a great dialog with the innovation industry in China. And we’re trying to bring products that we believe that we can bring value. And we believe that this product shows very-very nicely [Technical Issues] and can be absolutely consider [Indecipherable]. And where we can bring it to India in a very affordable prices versus the alternatives and this is our focus, we [Technical Issues] that’s what was the main incentives behind this. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Surya Patra from PhillipCapital. Please go ahead.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Surya Patra — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Yeah. Congratulation on the great set of numbers, sir. So, my first question is on the U.S. business front. So is it possible to share that, what is the sequential growth in the U.S. as we would have seen so for REVLIMID in the current quarter.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"So — so we cannot give guidance without [Technical Issues]. But what I can see, let’s say that we are very consistent. So likely just you’re going to continue to see growth in all of our spaces including United States with and without the products. And it will be driven primarily from a [Technical Issues] activity specifically for the United States, beside the regular meds we are going to launch somewhere between 25 to 30 products, as well as the contribution of recent acquisitions and likely that we will see also additional activity [Technical Issues].",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Surya Patra — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Sure, sir. So is it possible to give some extra color on the launch momentum that you have mentioned in your opening remark for the U.S. market, which you believe that to be strong in the current financial year.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, I think the investment in R&D and especially on the products that hopefully are likely to have less competition than the others is paying-off. And the as well as the type of pattern fleet that we will see in FY ’24 as well as the years after. So right now, the numbers that I mentioned 25 to 30 products it can be meaningful with the lesser of the competition. And we will continue to accumulate these products also in the years after. So, it’s absolutely our strategy in the U.S., and we will continue to focus on this.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Surya Patra — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Okay. Sir, my second question is on the composite question like we are seeing a strong cash accumulation and simultaneously, we are seeing multiple M&A activities by us to improve our focus on the domestic formulation business, which is at least around 20% of the total revenue base. And we are mentioning that this is going to be one of the focus market for us. So could you just could you share your thought process or the kind capital allocation to build this business in the near-future and our ultimately, what is the kind business mix, that you want to make, achieve it for domestic formulation considering the potential growth and all that, the second sales.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, absolutely. So, in India, our primary goals will be — will come from one, focusing on our brands. We identified focus therapeutic areas as well as the focus brands, and we have a doubled down on that by increasing our footprint by going to more cities, etc. So this is one of the goals. Specifically, to your question.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"The second one is that we are collaborating with the innovation industry in the United States, in Israel, in China in other places as well, of course, with companies and institutes in India to bring innovation to India. We are doing it both with our own internal R&D as well as with external R&D. Some of the deal I mentioned in my script and there are more to come. We are doing both on the Horizon-1 as well as Horizon-2 into and our best of [Technical Issues] people see us as a very attractive partner being compliant with all the international norms, given our reputation in the marketplace and we are leveraging it to bring more-and-more innovation into India.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"And there also power of the capital allocation will go to deals like this. In addition, we are always looking for opportunity also propositions. There was nothing that we can report at this stage, but it is absolutely something that we are open to do all-the-time. For the initial [Technical Issues] at location all of our spaces including U.S., [Technical Issues] India except our B2B business we are looking for potential complementary deals. The type of deals that we are looking for are always complementary. We’re looking for products that we don’t have or capabilities that we don’t have. It is unlikely that you’re going to see mega-deals or this kind stuff. This is not our comfortable zone. We are looking for primarily unmet needs or complementary products that will feature portfolio in this way. So yeah, please.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Surya Patra — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Yeah, sure sir. So that is really great to know. And just lastly any — any color that you can [Technical Issues] investing, expectations and the progress post-launch?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"So yeah, the product as you know is marketed by [Indecipherable]. So, I don’t have any — any expectation of anything like that. We as a partner, certain arrangements with them and as they will be successful, we will be successful as well.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Surya Patra — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Sure sir, wish you all the best. Thank you.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,Thank you. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Damayanti Kerai from HSBC. Please go ahead.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Damayanti Kerai — HSBC — Analyst,"Hi, thank you for the opportunity. My first question is on the U.S. business, you have been obviously very consistent in terms of new launches, but can you talk a bit more about the kind of price erosion, which we are seeing in your existing product and my second part of the question is compared to oral solids in injectables, what kind price erosion you are witnessing?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, so the nature of the U.S., the more change in the last quarter. It’s a similar, restructure of the market and similar behavioral players. Specifically for the quarter, the mix of products that we had, we saw less of the price erosion in the quarters before but fundamental structure of the market did not change, so likely [Technical Issues] when will face competition in certain products, then we see erosion. That’s the nature, but specifically, we saw a better mix this time. Comparing injectables to over solids, both are very competitive. So, it’s more of a function of how many players are attracting new customers. So both the injectables as well as our solids can see high-level of erosion, but also from time-to-time product with less competitive competition and therefore better situation.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Damayanti Kerai — HSBC — Analyst,"Sure. Thanks for that. My second question is. As you continue to invest in new business and long-term growth drivers, how do you see R&D and SG&A cost moving from here on? And you obviously have — I’ll say, done better than your aspirational EBITDA margin for this year, but on a more sustained basis, how do you see this, like margin trajectory moving?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"So, we are maintaining the 25-25 long-term, and we discussed it in previous meetings, and there will be yields in quarters that we will exceed it. There may be also yields that it will be below what happened also in the past. But we are very much there. What we are doing is that we are allocating the extra results between [Technical Issues]. And especially in R&D, the R&D likely to be somewhere between 8% to 9% also going-forward. And it’s naturally nominal will go up because we are going to sales, and this is allowing us to invest in the biologics. It’s allow us to invest in our products with our partners [Technical Issues] and we need to do some clinical trials and of course very important on the genetic R&D especially focusing on products with [Technical Issues] products that likely to have less competition.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Damayanti Kerai — HSBC — Analyst,"Okay, thank you. I’ll get back-in the queue.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Operator,"Thank you. Yeah, the next question from the line of Neha Manpuria from Bank of America. Please go ahead.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Neha Manpuria — Bank of America — Analyst,"Thanks for taking my question, sir, on the ROW markets historically, if I exclude the last year because of COVID impact, we have grown that market, north of 20% or 25%. As we go-forward should we see the ROW market going back to those levels of growth and this is excluding Russia?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Neha Manpuria — Bank of America — Analyst,"That’s my first question and second, on the India business, could you quantify the divestment income in the current quarter and excluding that how should we look at growth? Is there more divestment that we see from the India perspective or do you think this is the base on which we should grow. And do you think you can grow in-line with the market in India?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Hi Neha. On the ROW question, yes, the answer is yes, we are aiming for our traditional growth and also give or take without guidance that range of growth that we saw and indeed, when you are taking out all the one-offs and the fluctuation of currency we are growing very-very nicely. This is where primarily as we are accelerating the — the development and the filings of [Technical Issues] that in all these markets and also focusing on our footprint, especially on the hospital business. So yes, the answer we will be [Technical Issues] and — and in some of those marketing accelerated growth versus the past.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"As for India, the divestment was INR264 crores. And that’s the value we got. Specifically, if we see more, yeah, from time-to-time, but nothing significant that we are going and what we also very busy with these actually to bring more-and-more products and we are enhancing the collaboration discussions and the BD deals that will — will be for India. So, it’s a kind organic plus inorganic, but most of the inorganic would come from collaboration. That has been a kind M&A acquisitions of other companies.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Neha Manpuria — Bank of America — Analyst,"And just extending the question, do you think we can grow in-line with the market, keeping aside the collaborations, etc., because that would take time to reflect a number just from the effort that we’ve been putting in the business over the last few years. Could we see these go back to or at least try to get-in line with IBM Group?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,We believe that we should be better than [Technical Issues].,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Neha Manpuria — Bank of America — Analyst,In FY ’24 itself?,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,In FY ’24 and after.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Neha Manpuria — Bank of America — Analyst,"Understood. And one last question if I may on the Russia business I didn’t quite catch what you mentioned in the quarter, was there any specific impact from channel inventory being cleared in the quarter. I’m not sure what you mentioned?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"No, no, in this business, this is impossible.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
G V Prasad — Co-Chairman and Managing Director,"So, Neha that impact is actually in the base. If you remember when the conflict started, at that time there was up-stocking and to that extent in Q4 same time last year, the base was high and that’s impacting the year-on-year growth.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Neha Manpuria — Bank of America — Analyst,"Okay, there nothing specifically in this quarter.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so nothing specific happened in this quarter and most of the sequential decline stuff it’s primarily timing of products. There is a specific timing of tenders of the biologic products and the stuff like that, so. We can sell that in Russia’s business usual.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Neha Manpuria — Bank of America — Analyst,Got it. Thank you so much.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ankush Mahajan from Axis Securities. Please go ahead.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Ankush Mahajan — Axis Securities — Analyst,"Thanks for opportunity, sir. So, my question is [Indecipherable] element that has — incremental revenue for U.S. business. So could you throw some light on it. What is the sustainability run-rate for this molecule in the upcoming quarters. And excluding [Indecipherable], how do you see the EBITDA margins for U.S. business?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"So, on the product itself and it’s going to continue to be a meaningful [Indecipherable] product may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but it is going to be there probably for the entire agreement timelines. The fluctuation is primarily patterns of older than as you know, it’s a limited volume arrangement and — and we believe that it will serve us well to the entirety of the agreement.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"As for the — the activities outside of it, it’s going to continue to grow. I mentioned in previous discussions all-the-time we have products that have less competition than others. Naturally, this product is bigger than the others, but slightly, because in the future we are going to see products like this. And that’s what we are also focusing on and so the profitability, as well as the growth of our U.S. markets will continue to be in the same range also in years to come and quarters to come.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Ankush Mahajan — Axis Securities — Analyst,"And sir, what about the EBITDA margins that we — sustainable EBITDA margins?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Like I mentioned, we going to sustain the 25-25 on the long-term basis, we are not guiding for EBITDA for market, as you know, but — and from time-to-time will be more than that. And there will be many times about — above this, so it’s a function of how much we want to put into the R&D. Likely there will be higher to the time that we will have a [Technical Issues], and the combination of low complexity in products.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Ankush Mahajan — Axis Securities — Analyst,"Sir, if I do my calculations, excluding the [Technical Issues] this business is still on the lower side in terms of growth. So any strategy for the base business?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"I don’t share business observation. Thank you, sir. Thanks so much.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kunal Dhamesha from Macquarie. Please go ahead.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Kunal Dhamesha — Macquarie — Analyst,"Yeah, thank you for taking my question. So, the first question on strategy to leverage our U.S. Sandvik portfolio for Europe and other market. And we have seen significant growth in Europe geography over the last two-three years but in your [Technical Issues] journey, let’s say, in U.S., we have roughly around 140 and 150 products. How many products we would have already launched in Europe, how many in pipeline? And if you can throw some light there would be helpful.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, we decided to focus on Europe when we took the decision on the diversification, this is working well for us. And the end in terms of where are we in the journey somewhere in the beginning. And so I do see that most of the growth in Europe [Technical Issues] we are planning to launch many products in Europe in the next coming years, as well as to make move including inorganic. So we — So we see Europe as a focused market, especially around Germany. So Germany, would be the focal markets and of course, the rest of the countries in Europe. We believe we have to fulfill including biosimilar. So likely that you’ll continue to see the growth in Europe, also in the next coming years, including [Technical Issues].",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Kunal Dhamesha — Macquarie — Analyst,"And this leveraging of portfolio when you launch a product does it kind of become highly ROIC attractive in your view, even beyond what our aspirational target is or it helps us achieve that 25% ROIC target on a portfolio level, not in the product.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"It’s absolutely it is and because it’s an experimental leverage. So that’s — and obviously it’s a piece in the puzzle, you’ll hopefully, still relatively small than compared to the other spaces but although the time will say getting more-and-more positive impact on the overall [Technical Issues].",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Kunal Dhamesha — Macquarie — Analyst,"Sure, and the second question on the CTO-1 observation. What’s the kind of nature of observation and have we submitted the response to U.S. FDA or are in the process of submitting a response. Yeah, it’s a minor observation. We will address it. And we did not submit [Technical Issues] we just posted. I think we have 15 days of [Technical Issues]. So, we will submit within time. I believe that this will grow. Sure. Thank you, and all the best.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Madhav Marda from FII industries. Please go ahead.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Madhav Marda — FII industries — Analyst,"Hi, good evening. Thank you so much for your time. Just had one question. Basically, we have accumulated a lot of free-cash flow-in recent times, and I think, have been doing some M&A activity already. Just wanted to understand given I think in general, lot of the peers have good free-cash flows and net cash balance sheets in the industry. So, when we’re looking at M&A aren’t good subsidiary aggressively bid? We’ve seen that in the past as well in the industry. So just wanted to understand that for a good asset, is it easy to get it a good IRR or how should we think about M&A opportunities, given we have a good cash burn?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, so if you recall, it was part of our strategy to close the debts and the accumulated cash anticipating the situation, anticipating at the time, the increase in the interest-rate and inflation. So, we are now looking for opportunities. That one will, of course, fit us digitally, and second, we’ll be in good valuations will now. I think there are certain areas and certain type of products that potentially could get a good [Technical Issues] and that’s what we’re looking for.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"In addition to that, we are looking for, and we are using this money, so the type of licensing in, type of boosting the portfolio also for the future. And the money will be used also for debts. We are not the type of company that is seeking what we call, transformational acquisitions, that’s unlikely that you’ll see in ourcase. But we would see in hopefully more deals than we saw in the [Technical Issues].",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Madhav Marda — FII industries — Analyst,"So basically, our M&A will be more bolt-ons in the time that we’ve done in recent times as well. That’s the idea?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Let’s call it business development, which is including licensing and with including product acquisitions, collaboration with companies of the and also M&A.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Madhav Marda — FII industries — Analyst,"Got it, okay. Thank you.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories

Cyndrella Thomas Carvalho — JM Financial — Analyst,Thanks for the opportunity. Am I audible?,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Operator,"Yes, you are right. Please go ahead.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Cyndrella Thomas Carvalho — JM Financial — Analyst,"Sir, just wanted to clarify this on. Sorry for asking on generic Brinzolamide [Phonetic], but is the higher volumes, reflected in this quarter or will it be reflected next quarter?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"If you’re talking about Brinzolamide [Phonetic], we cannot share end quantity numbers. And what they said, is continuing to be meaningful to us. And — and in accordance to the agreement [Indecipherable], that we have.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Cyndrella Thomas Carvalho — JM Financial — Analyst,"Okay, thank you. And on the — in your opening remark, you highlighted about the Chinese product approvals that you have received. When and where should we start reflecting these into earnings and what is your outlook here. If you can help us understand?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, this is a reflection of the efforts that we had through the years by submitting for products — in China focused product. If we can get GA status and be one of the early entry before the market so. I think getting for approvals in less than a couple of weeks, it’s a big achievement for a company like us. What we see is we see pick-up all-the-time has a significant impact on our results. We will see [Indecipherable] over about, let’s say for starting in FY ’24, but more likely we see numbers in ’25 and ’26 fiscal as the submissions and their core and the timing of those GOP will take place, that’s what we anticipate. And right now we are in the pace of it’s product-submissions, and naturally with the cycle of the patterns in China and the timing of the GOP is. It will be more meaningful. But let’s say the strategy so-far it’s working well because it’s a level in which we have an outlet for that very-very important markets were [Technical Issues] forward.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Cyndrella Thomas Carvalho — JM Financial — Analyst,"Thank you. This is helpful. And coming to the PSAI business compared to your peers, we have not seen the top-line growth. However, the gross margins have definitely improved Q-on-Q. So how should we see the outlook for this business, and we’ve been positive on growing this business such, does anything change here at this point in time or is it some seasonal impact that we have seen in this quarter, and we should start seeing growth from next fiscal onwards, like how should we read this?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"We will see both, we will see growth, and we will see improvement of profitability. For us this — this market also in the past and excluding also in this segment, we used to record also COVID sales. So, if I’m excluding the COVID, what we saw is that time which was a decrease in prices of some old portfolio as well as increase some of the raw material. Now, we see the reverse what we see that we are launching new products and most of the sales are to more territories especially in Asia. And there we see also better mix of products, and we see an ease on the supply-chain and to a certain extent, procurement, so. So actually now I see positive momentum that is building on both growth as well as profitably.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Cyndrella Thomas Carvalho — JM Financial — Analyst,"But we should see this gross margin level sustaining, that the…",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"I hope that it will even enhance, not just sustain for sure, but we are aiming for enhancing.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Cyndrella Thomas Carvalho — JM Financial — Analyst,"And the top-line, any number that you would like to share like all the double digits, and the triple digits, anything. Any color would be helpful?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"No, we are aiming for double-digit, we are not guiding, but we are aiming double-digit for all of our markets including our [Indecipherable]",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories

Tushar Manudhane — Motilal Oswal Financial Services — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. Sir, again on North America sales given that FY ’23 had certain strength related exclusivity as well or generic Revlimid and competition to some extent kicking-in the — in the coming quarters. So, considering this aspect just would like to understand we still grow in FY ’24 U.S. sales, North-America sales?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"I believe that we will grow not just because of the product but we will go, because we are also launching 25 to 30 products. And the combination of all this mix should go up. Okay sir, thank you.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Operator,"Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashish Yash [Phonetic], IIFL Asset Management. Please go ahead.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Ashish Yash — IIFL Asset Management — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. So, I had this question, since we have been mentioning this 25% EBITDA margin guidance. But if we just try to strip out some one-time big opportunities and say some one-off non-recurring items, the EBITDA margins on the core business seem to be lower versus what we were earlier guiding for. Just if you could help us understand for FY ’24, as we go into FY ’24 would you like to provide some color as to, directionally what we, as investors, can expect?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"First, I don’t share the observation that is less than what we guide, so. So that’s a starting point and we are mainly to clarify. We will maintain in the 25-25 message on the long-term basis in which we will allow us both to grow you great return on the shareholders as well as the finance the future. And the — what you see is that we are building bigger and better portfolio as time goes by and the class — the balance sheet is probably the best-ever, in terms of both cash-flow as well as no — no additional substantial risk in the balance sheet. So, this is of course, allowing us to much better also, utilization of the working capital. So, this will allow us, a better ROCE also in the future.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Ashish Yash — IIFL Asset Management — Analyst,"Yeah, fair enough. Sir, lastly, on this India business. You did mention that FY ’24 or you expect to beat the IPM growth. And we have been acquiring assets those trying to strengthen our portfolio. What gives you the confidence that FY ’24 we can beat the industry growth? So just wanted to have some understanding on that.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"I’m confident that we will do it, and we need to recall that [Indecipherable]. I know that we are looking at external sources like IQVIA [Phonetic], etc. But the most important for me is what is our bottom-line growth. And that should be very healthy. So the answer is that I am confident, and I believe that we will grow the bottom-line even faster than we will grow the top line.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Ashish Yash — IIFL Asset Management — Analyst,"Okay, fair enough. Thanks, all the best.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nitin Agarwal from DAM Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital Advisors — Analyst,"Thanks for taking my question. It is on the main portfolio that we acquired in the U.S, can you help give us some more color on what opportunities do you see in that portfolio in terms of to grow the portfolio from the current size?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, say. It’s a portfolio that has certain level let’s say, lower level of competition, especially in women health. We are — it’s allowed us to get back to an open end, something that was missing for us towards the years. And it’s also — if there were many products in the pipeline that Mayne did not launch and something that we’ll be able to do in the future. So, if you issue, have people impact one, we believe that we can do well with these products. Second, we will be able to launch product and sales, we can launch some of these products in other markets. Relatively, the economy of the deal is relatively attractive for us. So, we are very pleased so-far with the progress of the main acquisition.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital Advisors — Analyst,"Right, so I think it’s fair to assume, given the new product launches that you have opportunities that you have you see possibilities for growing the business off of where we acquired it.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"That’s what we are aiming to, yeah.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital Advisors — Analyst,And from a profitability perspective is this is a business which is higher than our corporate profitability right now?,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,I don’t I cannot share information about the specific profitability of products. But we believe that the nature of the products and the mix of the products that have less competition is always available versus those with a high-level of competition. This is the nature of this [Technical Issues].,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital Advisors — Analyst,"And besides [Technical Issues] I can assume that you made-for this investment that you made, the U.S. generics, do we still are open to keep investing more money in U.S. generics by way of acquisition or this is more of a one of a special case transaction which came our way?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"We are we will continue to look for opportunities in the U.S. market, including genetics if it will fit to the financials and the and if it will be complementary to what we do. So, we will continue to look for opportunities, both organic and inorganic in the U.S. not just now, also in the future. It is a very important market for.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Nitin Agarwal — DAM Capital Advisors — Analyst,"Okay sir, thank you.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Prakash Agarwal from Axis Capital. Please go ahead.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, hi, good evening. Thanks for the opportunity. Just if I heard that right. Just wanted to reconfirm that you mentioned that you expect double-digit growth from across markets including the U.S., would that be correct?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"I do note this is every quarter and not necessarily all-the-time, but absolutely this is the long-term [Technical Issues] for us, including in the — absolutely, that’s what we are aiming also in the short-term, but I cannot but I must say that this will happen every quarter, and [Technical Issues] maybe the situation.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"So sir, I speak for fiscal ’24, specifically, sir.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Specifically, that’s what we are aiming. We are aiming for double-digit growth.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,And with excluding the acquisition with the base portfolio and some one-offs it is possible as what you see.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,I believe that it is possible.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay. That is helpful. And just a follow-up on this, the U.S. generic market, many companies have been talking about, while price erosion remains more or less similar. There is lot of volume opportunities that is coming. New business opportunities, etc. So would you say that we would have also got these in the last three, six months given there some U.S. FDA issues with the peer set?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,I’m not sure I understand the FDA comments. Can you clarify that?,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Yeah, so what we hear from some of the peers is that we are getting some volume opportunities like, new business opportunities and MBOs where they need to supply a few of the products where earlier they were not contracted largely due to the U.S. FDA issued by the peers. So are we getting some volume-based opportunities to supply in the U.S. market.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"We do from time-to-time. I would — I’m not considering it as strategic issue, but we do from time-to-time ahead of this situation. So give or take, if I say correctly about 10% to 15% of the SKU in the United States in some a shortage from all kinds of reasons, not just the FDA. But all kinds of [Indecipherable] and in those situation, you are always in a [Technical Issues]. It’s a one-time buy and stuff like that.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"And would you — have you seen anything incremental in the last quarter, is what I’m trying to get some color on? Given we have seen some large companies having [Technical Issues].",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so nothing that I see as strategic. We are not building ourself [Technical Issues] of others there. We are trying to build ourselves with our own capabilities.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Fair enough, fair enough. And lastly on the run-rate that we see in the past, it was 225 million and then it came back, the base business side, 250 and then we saw some, big — big jumps and now things are normalizing and you still maintain it is going to be volatile, but materials and I also understand that market-share of REVLIMID it changes by increases every 6 to 12 months, or maybe calendar year.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,So would it be fair to say that with the new launches that you spoke about and REVLIMID continuing and this is in addition to the first question. So that is the key to grow double-digit. Would that be a fair assessment that on that REVLIMID base also you will grow?,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,The growth in the United States will be from new products as well as volume from other product as well as better costing. It is all of that will contribute absolutely. But I cannot guide you on with and without this kind stuff. I will not be able to do this.,DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Okay, okay, lovely. And lastly, on the while you spoke about growth across markets, would you say that this kind launch and product visibility across markets. These kind margins could be sustainable?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, I believe so. I believe that’s why we are guiding for the 25 – 25, which will enable us even to finance always into. So, if you recall, we said that about 50 to 100 basis-points on the Horizon-2 and we are able to cater this within the margins. So and the — so we are very strategically positioned well, that we are able to finance our future and at the same time to provide this margins in our to the shareholders.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"No, but we are doing better than what we are guiding right, that’s what I’m asking. Will we able to continue with this kind of performance?",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Erez Israeli — Chief Executive Officer,"Now we are doing better and — and maybe there will be also a period of time, this will be not better. But right now we are doing better.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories 
Prakash Agarwal — Axis Capital — Analyst,"Okay, lovely. Thank you, and all the best.",DRREDDY,Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories

George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"We have declared an interim dividend for the financial year ’23 of of 220%, that is INR22 per equity share of INR10, involving a payout of INR883 crores. We have raised INR250 crores through the 30th public issue of secured, redeemable, NCD. And we have also launched a new marketing campaign, Kholiye Khushiyon Ki Tijori. So this is the gist of the financial results of this year. I think now I would stop here and over the phone to questions and comments from the investors. Thank you.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,Questions and Answers:,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Operator,Thank you very much up. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal. Please go ahead.,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Abhijit Tibrewal — Motilal Oswal — Analyst,"Yes, thank you, and good evening, everyone. Sir, I have two questions. And first of all, now congratulations to you and the team, definitely a very, very strong quarter in terms of gold loan growth. So, sir, I mean, my questions predominantly revolve around that. Just want to understand from last quarter to this quarter what has really changed that has helped us deliver such strong growth in new gold loans. Is it predominantly, I mean, higher prices — higher gold prices or is it also to do with some lowering of aggression that you are seeing from maybe banks? That is the first question, basically what is it that has helped you kind of deliver such strong gold loan growth during the quarter. And secondly, sir, if you could just explain why is there such a sharp jump in your employee expenses during the quarter versus last quarter or for matter the last quarter of the prior year.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"Okay, thank you. Gold loan growth for this quarter has been robust. A few things helped. We have actually started a great campaign for all our branches and staff to do more gold loan business, and I think that has paid dividends. Our brand ambassadors and our gold loan initiatives also see results, and that is what I also said last time. Secondly, the economic activity has also — has started picking up and the demand for loans and gold loans have increased in this quarter. As you definitely said, that higher gold price has also helped, but not to the extent of the growth, but definitely it has helped. And again, as I was saying last time also, I feel that gradually the competition for the excitement of the banks, etc., in gold loan is slowly waning because as [indecipherable] the excitement of the banks, etc., to gold loan also waning[phonetic] and that is also a fact. So that is one part of it. The gold price [indecipherable]. But most important, we have been — the economic activities have picked up and we see gold demand and our prices have also started bringing in more and more. The increase in the number of employees, we have increased more than 1,000 employees during this quarter, that must be one of the reasons for that. And overall, this — there’ll always hike in the salary also — increment salary also comes in every quarter — every year, probably this will step-up this year. We have not looked so much into this. There’s no big aberration we see with that.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Abhijit Tibrewal — Motilal Oswal — Analyst,"Perfect. Sir, just one last follow-up question here. Just wanted to [Technical Issues] that given that we talked about these couple of things, higher gold prices helping economic activity picking up, which is leading to better gold loan demand and the margin excitement of banks in gold loans. Is it kind of giving you higher confidence of a better — or let me put it this way, would you now start guiding for higher gold loan growth versus what you’ve been guiding in the last two quarters? Sir, one more question on the sector. Just wanted to understand, is it a common practice in gold lending that once the contracted tenor gets over, a customer can repay the interest and then that gold loan can be rolled over based on the current market prices of gold prices? Is that a common practice in the gold lending industry? And the other thing is, related question here is, have you had some conversations with the RBI around this practice?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"Okay. Your question was whether we see better growth in the coming months. Yes, that’s what we see. And we had — for several years, we have been guiding a growth of 15%, and only last year, we were — or just past year, we were unable to do the 15%. We were able to do only about 7%. But I’m sure, this year, we should be doing in excess of 15% this year growth. So that’s what we’ll come back to the earlier 15% plus growth this year, that is the first part of it. The second one, you said people coming after the PD. So on the gold loan side, 90% of the loans get closed before 12 months. It’s only that the 10% which goes beyond the 12 months. [indecipherable] may come for that, and this — because this is so fungible and easy, because there is no entry loan, exit loan. It is easy for the customer to go and so on and take the same loan, etc. So it is better for us to or to collect the interest and then renew the loan up, at that time. But now far and few, very few people who do that. Most of them, before 12 months it is almost closed. Very few customers who go beyond because our period is not — some companies have three months, six months, etc., our loan tenure is 12 months. So after 12 months, 90% — more than 90%, 95% of the customers close their loan at that time.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Abhijit Tibrewal — Motilal Oswal — Analyst,"Got it, sir. So this is useful now. Maybe I’ll come back in the question queue if time permits. Thank you so much, and wish you and the team the very best for the next year.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rahul Shah from Shah Associates. Please go ahead.,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Rahul Shah — Shah Associates — Analyst,"Good evening, everyone, and good evening, Mr. George Alexander Muthoot, I am a big fan of yours. So my first question is, you said in the previous con calls that — and also in the TV interviews that Muthoot Finance is a very operationally-intensive business. So can you tell me what exactly do you mean by that and how exactly the fintech players and the bank, whether they are small bank or big bank, not able to replicate that model of yours — to compete with that model of yours. How operationally-intensive is it?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I didn’t said about Muthoot Finance, I had said about gold loan business. Gold loan business of Muthoot Finance is an operationally intensive business because, first, the gold has specifically counter the price, it has to be physically weight checked and also [indecipherable] or should we say, alternative for that. And second, this has to be checked [indecipherable] has to be collected, and then [Technical Issues] more than all the other usual photos, the KYCs, etc. They have to physically pack it, check it, and keep it in the strong room. We have also, what should we say, look at the safety of the strong room and the gold ornament and we have to again when the customer comes back to release it, they have to release it in good time. A loan is given maybe 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes’ time. When it is released, when we give it back, we give it in three, four minutes’ time, which includes also a security system, safety security system which we have in our branches to store and take care of the gold, because we have an earlier very many attempts at break-in all the way the vault, etc., and all this attracts all these elements who try to steal these things, that is one part of it. So we have to take care of that. It’s not always anybody who does that, as we take care of that.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"The second thing is, again, the staff. The staff also — we have been very careful with the staff also because this is gold and cash, which is very attractive for maybe even for the staff also to do some sort of malpractice, that also has to be done. So we have a team of more than 1,000 physical inspectors or auditors who visit branches frequently maybe once in a week, once in two weeks, depending on the size of the branch, once in a month to check — randomly check the gold packets there with numbers, with quality. So this is operationally very challenging because we have to return the gold to the customer. Actually, the customer has to have big trust in a gold loan company to hand over the INR100 rupees note and take INR60 or INR70 note from them. [indecipherable]. So the trust is also very important. So all this quite a lot of operations challenges and that over the years we have been able to train our staff also for even the checking of the gold — the assessing of the gold. We don’t employ [indecipherable]. That’s what I meant when I meant by all this operationally challenging. Somebody thinks of this looks easy, but operationally this is integrated. That’s what I meant.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Rahul Shah — Shah Associates — Analyst,"Okay, sir. And next question is, is there AUM dependent on gold prices totally or there are some other factors as well and how do you plan to utilize those factors to grow that? And secondly, where do you see your company in the next five to 10 years, both in terms of number of branches and also profitability, specifically for the gold loan segment?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"So I think I answered part of that in the first question, that is, there are quite a few things. Gold price is also a part of it because somebody can get more money on their existing loan, that is gold price is also one part of it, but that may be only a small part of it. The most important part is, somebody should definitely need the money and they should be available in that place to do their loan, they should need a loan amount and they should have the gold with him and he should have the mental presence to purchase gold and take money, not something else. And so if all these things come together, let the business is there. And your question about growth, I don’t have guidance, that we have been growing 15% in the gold loan business for the year, except for last year, which is a difficult year for us for very many reasons which I have explained earlier, but now I think we are again back on the 15% plus growth path. And I’m sure we should be able to do that not only one year in the — more years to come also. 15% is something which we would call it [indecipherable]. And so the [Technical Issues] shortly, we should be opening about 150, 200 branches in a year, that is something which we looked — we look at the need and necessity for branches in each area and then go on and go do that. And the profitability is, when the business also grows, we should see profit also going up proportionately at least.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Mr. Shah, may we request that you return to the question queue for follow-up questions. Ladies and gentlemen, in order to ensure that the management is able to address questions from all participants in the conference, please limit your questions to two per participant. Should you have a follow-up question, we would request you to rejoin the question queue. The next question is from the line of Nidhesh from Investec. Please go ahead.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nidhesh Jain — Investec — Analyst,"Thanks for the opportunity. Firstly, on the yields, what are the incremental yields that we have got in this quarter on the gold loan business and is there an impact of penal interest circular — draft circular that we foresee on the business? And second part of the question is on digital lending that you are starting. Can you talk about how are we approaching the customers who are eligible for these personal loans? How do we plan to scale the collection infrastructure for that? These are the two questions, sir.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,"So the yield for the quarter is 18.48%, and in Q3, it was 18.22%. I think we have been more or less able to stabilize the teaser loans, which were there in the past. I think going forward, it should remain around these levels. As far as, the penals are just — circular, I think it’s — still it is in draft form. Let’s penal on the final circular. So whatever is — at the end of the day, if you need to raise a particular amount of revenue, we have to raise it, whether as charges or as interest. So we’ll take a call at that point of time.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Operator,"Thank you. Mr. Nidhesh, does that answer your question?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nidhesh Jain — Investec — Analyst,"Yes, there is also a follow-up question on digital lending. If you can share how we’re reaching the customers who are eligible for these loans and also share the collection strategy in case of bounce and overdue?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"So we actually — we don’t do any digital lending. We do — we lend only to the customers who come to our branch. So who are our existing customers, we give them a personal loan based on this call, etc., they have given an EMI loan. And collection strategy for the usual collection things, so nothing different about it.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Unidentified Speaker —,"So for faster processing, digital capabilities are useful. [Speech Overlap]",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"Locating customers and probably giving them their disbursal, that’s all.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nidhesh Jain — Investec — Analyst,"Okay, sure. Sure, thank you, sir. Thank you.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nikhil Nyati from Equirus Securities. Please go ahead.,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nikhil Nyati — Equirus Securities — Analyst,"Good evening, sir. Am I audible?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"Yeah, yeah, please. Yes, yes.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nikhil Nyati — Equirus Securities — Analyst,"Congratulations on a good set of numbers. Sir, I have just one question regarding the new players that are coming into the market. They have high opex, but their low base absorb the opex. And I just wanted to know your view how do they gain businesses. Through channel checks, we have understood that they are reducing the interest rates to gain business. Have you come across any instances wherein have you lost the business through these people — to these people? Thank you.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"I do not know that new NBFCs coming with lower interest rates, etc. Probably banks come up for lower interest rates, etc., but I don’t know if both are newer NBFCs coming and offering the competitive rate of interest. As you said, opex definitely is there. I don’t know how they are accounting for these opex, whether they are accounting it on a pro rata basis also, I am not sure. So definitely there is opex, and then not aware of any new NBFCs, which have come and probably given very low rates of loans, gold loans. I’m not aware of those companies.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nikhil Nyati — Equirus Securities — Analyst,"Okay. And sir, the next question is just a data keeping question. Can you give the AUM breakup with regards to the ticket size between INR1 lakh — INR1 lakh to INR2 lakh and above INR2 lakh? Yeah, just a minute. Yeah, I think the average ticket size is above INR70,000. The average ticket size is INR70,000.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,"So Nikhil, no — this information — right now, I don’t have this information. We’ll — we can provide you later.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nidhesh Jain — Investec — Analyst,"Okay, okay, that answers my question. Sir, I’ll join the follow-up queue, if I have any further questions. Thank you.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Operator,Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nischint Chawathe from Kotak Institutional Equities. Please go ahead.,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nischint Chawathe — Kotak Institutional Equities — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Can you mention the quantum of auctions done this quarter?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,"Auction — see, auction is very low, I think around INR27 crores.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nischint Chawathe — Kotak Institutional Equities — Analyst,"[Speech Overlap] And last quarter, third quarter?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,Just give me a second. INR233[Phonetic] crores.,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nischint Chawathe — Kotak Institutional Equities — Analyst,"Sure. And there has been a fair amount of pile-up of NPA, so do you expect large blocks of auction in the first or second quarter [Speech Overlap] at some point of time now?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, yeah. See, these NPAs up because they have crossed the 12 months plus three months period. But then many of these — very many of these customers who are there in this, have paid interest rates, etc., and they have also requested for some more time for us. So we are in the money for all these loans and we don’t expect any interest in these accounts. We have around 7.5 tons of gold as far as these NPAs are concerned.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nischint Chawathe — Kotak Institutional Equities — Analyst,So there may not be any large block of auctions [Speech Overlap].,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,"No, sir. No, sir.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nischint Chawathe — Kotak Institutional Equities — Analyst,"Sure. And the other thing was on the cost front, would you say that, on a cost basis, how much of it could be sort of one-off and how much of it would be sustainable going forward?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,"I think this quarter, it is slightly higher because of the — because when you have a higher growth, we may have higher amount of incentives to the employees, that is one thing. And on the Directors’ remuneration also, there is an annual performance incentive, which is booked. So otherwise, I think it should more or less remain somewhere around 3.5 percentage at least for some more time.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nischint Chawathe — Kotak Institutional Equities — Analyst,"Sure. And anything that you envisage — just last question, if anything that you envisage in terms of increase in cost of funds?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,"So I think the borrowing cost is going up. I think most of the banks [indecipherable] are around 8.5 percentage. So I think the cost of borrowings should move in that direction unless we start seeing reversal. I think last few days or week, we are seeing some sort of softening of the rate. But till that happens in a major way, I think it should move more toward 8.5 percentage in next few quarters.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"Even if the interest cost goes up 20, 30 bps, we should be able to pass it on to our customers, because then — that is with the cost of funds is increasing for us, is increasing for everybody in the market. So [indecipherable]. So I don’t think we have any — we do not have any difficulty in passing on such incremental borrowing cost to our customers.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nischint Chawathe — Kotak Institutional Equities — Analyst,"Sir, got it. And I think you mentioned that the trajectory of business in the last one-and-a-half months is strong.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"Okay, thank you.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Nischint Chawathe — Kotak Institutional Equities — Analyst,"Yeah, thanks.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,Thank you.,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Operator,[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Rajiv Mehta from YES Securities. Please go ahead.,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Rajiv Mehta — YES Securities — Analyst,"Yeah, sir. Thank you for giving me the opportunity. So sir, while you were talking about competitive intensity from banks for the margin slightly waning, so far, we have not seen any reflection of it hitting your customer metrics. So when you look at the number of new customers acquired or even reactivation of old customer or even additional loan on additional collateral to existing customer, that metric has been moving pretty slowly, it’s been very stable. So how do you — how do we see this metrics kind of improving in the future and what can drive more customer acquisition, more customer activation, what choices we will put for that?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"So we have been putting quite a few marketing initiatives. We are doing a lot of outside market activities also, that is definitely bringing in customers. So the initial [indecipherable] is a very short-term product. Now, its tenure of three to four to five months is very short. So customers go, new customers come, existing customers come back again, so it is not that we get north of new customers to this, the new customer additions are there. Definitely, we have added customers — new customers have been added this year. New costs have been added, that also happens. So I think — it’s an ongoing process we’ll be doing. More and more initiatives to get more business, more customers, new customers also. Also, existing customers can also bringing more of their loan because what we have seen is every customer has more than one loan, probably with us or somebody else. We think more of this old business — more of the existing gold loan business from other institutions also is very good. So the existing customers can be giving us more and more business also.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Rajiv Mehta — YES Securities — Analyst,"And sir, do we internally track that more percentage of customers, which went to competition in the last couple of years, because of their heightened activity, are coming back to us?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"See, these are small loans. We don’t know how to keep a track of somebody who has gone to another bank and have come back [Technical Issues] he has gone to another bank, because he did not takeover, etc., so each — and I don’t know whether he closed in, took the next loan from probably another bank. And the third loan, instead of going to that bank after probably he [indecipherable]. So very difficult to keep that track because it’s not a [indecipherable] property, etc. So if it’s a property, we would have known. This property was [indecipherable] to that bank and now it is come to us. So this is — for example, gold loan. So I don’t think — it’s really the impression we get from our field team in the branch that people, whether they have gone in, etc., is the impression we get from all of this. Every customer, you will see go elsewhere, he comes, closes our loan, and then goes for the next loan[phonetic]. So we do not know where the customer is going.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Rajiv Mehta — YES Securities — Analyst,"And sir, just lastly, any change in the product level interest rate in recent months, including [indecipherable]?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"No, I think we constantly do tweaking of the products region-wise, geography-wise, etc., to cater to different sectors and different regions[phonetic], so that is an ongoing process. There are not really violent changes[phonetic]. There are not really — as you would have seen, we are not thinking of any ultra-low teaser rates, etc., but of course, we always offer a different rate. So maybe a 12% loan is always there, 14% is there, 18% is there, 19% loan is there. All these loans are there. So what we need is from a consolidated or a blended ease is what they are looking at. So what — as Oommen said earlier, we have about [indecipherable] is a blended yield.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Rajiv Mehta — YES Securities — Analyst,"Got it, sir. Thank you so much. Best of luck.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Shweta Daptardar from Elara Capital. Please go ahead.,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Shweta Daptardar — Elara Capital — Analyst,"Thank you, sir, for the opportunity. So I have a couple of questions. The first one is, while the teaser loan portfolio is behind and they have been migrated to higher interest rates. So have they been migrated, say, from a 7%, 8-percent-odd to directly 18%, 19% plus?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"That’s your question? Okay. See, there is no migrations, etc., this is [indecipherable]. When he comes for the new loan, they have to take that new loan at a new rate. New rate can be 12%, 18%, 15%, etc. It’s not that somebody has been migrated from 6% to 18%, no, no. We would have stopped that scheme and customer has to redeem that loan and probably when he comes for the next loan, he’ll have to jump in at this new existing rate.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Shweta Daptardar — Elara Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Sir, secondly, as far as growth is concerned. So first, commendable growth on the gold loan traction, on the gold loan side. But just — because you mentioned that, it cannot be completely attributed to gold price, right, of course, you gave other reasons. But historically, if I go back and see that Q4 is always a seasonally strong quarter. Sir, is there a seasonality? And if so, what does that thing, which is driving the seasonality every fourth quarter of the year? And then if the answer is, yes, then how do you see quarter-on-quarter gold loan momentum for next two quarters?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"Okay, so what we said is, on the fourth quarter, yes, we agree that it’s a good quarter. This year’s fourth quarter has been a historical high. That’s what we said. Historical high of the fourth quarter. So compared to any other fourth quarter, this was the highest. That is the first part of it. Second is that we have given a guidance of about — of 15% plus this full year, so probably we should be able to [Technical Issues] in the coming next year. So every quarter, we should see better — it’s not that every quarter can be the highest quarter. So we see that we get the 15% overall yearly growth.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Shweta Daptardar — Elara Capital — Analyst,"Yes, sir, that was great. Sir, one last question I’m squeezing in. Sir, we have also seen stunning improvement this particular quarter. You also mentioned that there are customers who open and close the accounts, there are renewals happening. So is this the reason — so what is the reason for stunning improvement at a time when competitive intensities has been still flaring up?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"When the overall growth happens, [indecipherable] also has to go up. It is not directly proportional to the growth because the gold price is also a factor. So — but then, you are seeing a gold loan growth in this quarter. So [indecipherable] also has to go up.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Shweta Daptardar — Elara Capital — Analyst,"Okay. Okay, I’ll come back — I’ll take this offline. Thank you.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited

Bunty Chawla — IDBI — Analyst,"Congrats, sir, on a good set of numbers and thank you for giving me the opportunity. First, the — sorry, I have joined late if you’ve already shared that number. Branch expansion for this year and RBI approval for number of branches, what was that number?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"So we had an approval for 150 branches, and this quarter, we opened 67 branches. And I think that 150 is complete, so on an ongoing basis, we will be opening more branches.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Bunty Chawla — IDBI — Analyst,So for this FY ’24 what is the target of branch openings?,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited

Bunty Chawla — IDBI — Analyst,"Yes, sir, yes",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"Now, it is INR70,000.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited

Shubhranshu Mishra — PhillipCapital — Analyst,"Good evening, sir. Three questions. The first one is, what is the net customer attrition we have seen in the last two odd years because of the competitive intensity? First part. Second is, is the competition also from various other NBFCs and from banks which are into small ticket personal loan and then there are small ticket business loans? And the third question is, what is the total payout to Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Madhuri Dixit annually for brand promotion, sir?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,"Your first question was about — what was the first question, Shubhranshu, can you repeat your first question?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Shubhranshu Mishra — PhillipCapital — Analyst,What is the net customer attrition in the last two odd years?,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,Customer attrition.,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Oommen K. Mammen — Chief Financial Officer,"So first of all, there is a slide in our presentation. So if you look at, there is a customer addition of 3.3 lakhs during this quarter. And overall, if you look at the total customers — number of customers have increased by — increased from 52.33 lakh to 53.23 lakh, so that is a net increase in the customer addition and also the new customer addition numbers we have given. So the point you need to see is that, we have a large customer base, and every quarter we have been able to add around 3, 3.5 lakh new customers. So we have a large customer base, a lot of them have avail the loan and a lot of them currently not availed, which we tried to tap them on a regular basis. That’s what we give always the information about fresh loans to inactive customer.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"The customer base is, those customers who have presently a loan with us. If this is a very short period loan, it gets churned every three months, four months.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"Okay, the second question was? What was your second point, sir?",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
Shubhranshu Mishra — PhillipCapital — Analyst,Are we facing competition from other NBFCs and contextually small ticket business loans and small ticket personal loans?,MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited 
George Alexander Muthoot — Managing Director,"So I don’t think people who take gold loan, definitely will also be taking some other loans also. So it is not that — because somebody is getting a small ticket loan, etc., he is substituting it for a gold loan or a gold loan substituting for that. I don’t think we have never faced such a situation, sir. About Amitabh Bachchan, etc., I think we pay some decent money to them, sir.",MUTHOOTFIN,Muthoot Finance Limited
